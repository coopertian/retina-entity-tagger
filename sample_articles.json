In Bahrain and Poland, the bank's credit card business has increased on average by about a third over the last two years, it said.\n\"UAE, Bahrain and Poland are our high performers. We have very good positions in regard to our credit card business in UAE, Bahrain and Poland,\" said Anil Wadhwani, chief executive of consumer and commercial banking for Citigroup in EMEA.\nLending to consumers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa rose by 10 percent to $6.7 billion during the first quarter, the fastest growth by region globally, according to the bank's latest earnings presentation.\nEconomic growth in the UAE is forecast by the IMF to reach 3.2 percent in 2015, with Bahrain's growth estimated by the fund  at 2.7 percent. Poland's economy has outshone most others in the European Union by growing through the global financial crisis. \nThose markets are in contrast to Russia, where the bank has been reducing its exposure in recent months as sanctions bite against the economy.\nIn Britain, where the bank does not have a credit card business, its debit card business was doing \"reasonably well,\" said Wadhwani.\nIt is in the process of exiting its three other consumer markets in the region -- Egypt, Czech Republic and Hungary -- moves that should be completed this year. \nMore than half of the bank's consumer lending globally during the first quarter was in North America, with EMEA representing only 2.4 percent of the total, according to the bank's latest earnings presentation.\nLike many other banks, Citigroup has been focusing on growing its wealth management business for high net worth individuals, particularly as tight net interest margins pressure revenue from lending across much of the region.\nThe UAE and Bahrain offer particularly fertile ground for that, with both countries featuring in the top 12 of a 2013 Boston Consulting Group index of countries with the highest density of millionaire households in the world. \n\"It's growing at a very fast pace, particularly those with assets over $100,000 up to $25 million,\" said Wadhwani.\n (Reporting By Tom Arnold; Editing by \nKeith Weir", "source": "reuters", "keywords": ["bahrain", "uae", "citigroup", "bank", "card business", "card", "wadhwani", "emea", "growth"], "guid": "us-citigroup-growth-idUSKBN0NZ1K2"}

The question left many of them stumped. CNN released a video of the awkward encounters on Wednesday. \nSeveral of the people questioned by Moody \ncited Ronald Reagan\n, who died in 2004. One candidate, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, admitted he didn't know how to answer the question.\n\"I don't know. I'd have to think about that one for a long time,\" Carson said, adding, \"I think everybody has their good points and their bad points.\"\nThe question poses obvious problems for the Republican field. Of the five living presidents, three are Democrats: President Barack Obama, President Bill Clinton, and President Jimmy Carter. The two living Republicans, President George H.W. Bush and President George W. Bush, are both relatives of a likely 2016 candidate, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R). Furthermore, President George W. Bush left office as one of the most unpopular presidents of all time and some members of the current GOP field have taken shots at him.\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Florida), Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R), and Republican businessman Donald Trump \nall named Reagan\n in response to Moody's question.\n\"I'll leave that for the people to decide,\" Cruz said fo the greatest living president, \"Certainly, the greatest president of recent generations was Ronald Reagan.\"\n\"I really talk about a president who died relatively recently ... Ronald Reagan,\" Trump said.\nTwo of the Republicans questioned by Moody offered praise for the Bushes. Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum said the greatest living president was \"probably a Bush.\" In the past, Jindal has said President George W. Bush was the best president since Reagan. He reiterated his praise for Bush in his conversation with Moody.\n\"I think that I would give George W. Bush credit for keeping our country safe after 9/11,\" Jindal said.\nFormer Texas Governor Rick Perry walked away when confronted with Moody's question. \nWatch Moody's video about the question \"that stops Republican presidential hopefuls in their tracks\" \nNOW WATCH: \n11 amazing facts about Vladimir Putin ", "source": "business_insider", "keywords": ["moody", "bush", "president", "reagan", "question", "living", "republican", "greatest living", "george", "cruz", "presidents", "jindal"], "guid": "http://www.businessinsider.in/Republican-presidential-candidates-had-trouble-answering-this-very-basic-historical-question/articleshow/47286492.cms?utm_source=ten_minutes_with&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Content_Patnership"}

The highly anticipated\u00a0PC release of Rockstar\u2019s Grand Theft Auto V sold 441,000 copies in the United States last month, boosting\u00a0PC game sales. Mobile also helped digital game growth, breaking new records with more than 147 million Americans playing on smartphones and tablets\u00a0in April. This brought monthly revenues up 13 percent to $380 million.\n\u201cMobile is the fastest growing, fastest changing platform for games in history,\u201d Stewart Rogers, an analyst at VB Insight said. \u201cAccording to research, mobile games alone will reach \n$45 billion by 2018\nOther segments of the digital games market, including social and MMO games, are down for the month. SuperData says that social games continue to disappoint, falling under the $40 average paying user mark for the first time in half a year. A continued decline is expected as users interests move from Facebook games\u00a0to smartphone and tablet games.\nMassively online multiplayer games also saw a drop, with online players bases down\u00a018 percent since last year\u2019s peak. Activision Blizzard revealed that subscriber numbers for its\u00a0\nWorld of Warcraft flagship MMO fell from 10 million to 7.1 million\n\u00a0earlier this month. But the publisher is seeing benefits from the growth of digital games anyway \u2014 it reported $538 million in digital revenue for the quarter.\u00a0And growth is expected with the upcoming launch of online battle arena game\u00a0Heroes of the Storm, which already has 11 million signups ahead of its June launch.\nE-sports continues to grow as a marketing tool for publishers such as Riot Games (League of Legends) and Valve (Dota 2). SuperData says that the global competitive gaming market currently attracts \n134 million viewers and $612 million in spending worldwide\n.

Here are five young designers to check out.\nBashar Assaf \nBashar Assaf was nominated for the International Woolmark Prize this year.\n\"People always told me 'you should please the client because that's how you make your money' -- I don't do this at all,\" says Bashar Assaf. \nWhile perhaps ill-advised, this cavalier attitude, in sharp contrast to the young designer's baby face and sweet welcome to his atelier, has stood Assaf in good stead so far in his short career. \nHis collection has been sold at the Galeries Lafayette in Dubai and this year he was nominated for the International Woolmark Prize.\nPerhaps most controversially, the theme of his latest collection was \"Four Stages of a Climax.\"\nUnwilling to compromise his own brand, the Ecole Superieure des Arts et Techniques de la Mode Beirut-trained designer is currently supplementing his income with a collection of abayas for the Saudi market, with the backing of a Saudi partner. \nDespite the restrictions imposed by conservative Saudi law, Assaf has managed to sneak in cuts and color blocking he is proud to call his own. \"It's still my style, in a way,\" he says. \nJust don't tell the customers.\nNour Hage \nNour Hage's designs diverge from the pretty, polished effect that many Lebanese women prefer. .\nThe French authorities, apparently, were somewhat less than understanding.\nThis edgy aesthetic is palpable in her three collections so far, as well as the two mid-season single-piece capsule collections she's produced. The pieces are all dark tones, with the exception of one blood red dress.\nHage's designs diverge from the pretty, polished effect that many Lebanese women prefer. \n\"You can always find traces of Beirut's imperfections in my collections; everything is always asymmetrical, raw, a bit rough,\" she says. \"In Beirut, it's always new, shiny, polished buildings next to a building that's been falling over since the civil war. It's that contrast that I really like.\"\nOutside Lebanon, several of Hage's A/W 2015 pieces will be available at the boutique And Friends in St. Petersburg. \nShe's also hoping to begin selling in Rome next year. \"A fan base has sprung up there,\" she says, a product of her social media campaigns.\nNour Hage's collection is available at the Santiago boutique in downtown Beirut (Palladium Building, Omar Daouk Street; +961 01 993 216). Pieces are between $140 and $360.\nTimi Hayek \nTimi Hayek's Beirut boutique has been open since April 2015..\nSpeaking to tiny Timi Hayek, it's almost possible to imagine what her clothes look like before you even see them. \nShe's impossibly sweet and youthful, quick to laugh, but much too articulate to be called ditsy.\nInspired by mythology and nature, the print designer, trained at London's Central St. Martin's College, imbues her clothes with a dreamy, whimsical aspect. \nSilk scarves, tops and dresses feature her intricate depiction of Nijinsky's sylvan \"Afternoon of a Faun\" ballet performed in Paris by the Ballets Russes in 1912, including nymphs, tiny animals and verdant nature. \nShe uses heavy fabrics like burlap and rough linen to make frilly, pleated frocks and crop tops.\nHoused in a 1940s brick building constructed at the direction of her great-grandmother (a Lebanese supermarket tycoon who made her fortune in Gambia), Hayek's boutique has only been open since April 2015. \nSales have been \"growing slowly,\" she says, as she teaches herself how to run a retail business.\nHer next project will bring things closer to home. \nIt's too soon to reveal details, but it'll be another silk print, this time inspired by the \"nature, history and mythology of Lebanon,\" she says, smiling shyly.\nTimi Hayek's boutique is located at the top of Monnot Street, Achrafiyeh. Appointments can be arranged by calling +961 01 611 545. Tops start at $90, dresses top out at $600.\nKrikor Jabotian \nKrikor Jabotian's wedding dresses sell for $25,000.\nA graduate of Starch's first class of designers, Jabotian began developing his client base beginning in 2008, before the flow of Gulf tourists coming to Lebanon stopped due to the war in neighboring Syria. \nHe has managed to retain their business despite the decrease in tourist traffic and, unlike many of his peers, he hasn't struggled with growing his business.\nThis may be because he's not selling the kind of pieces that tourists casually pick up as a souvenir. \nThese are destination dresses: Jabotian's wedding gowns start at $25,000 and are hand sewn, embroidered and pearled down to the last detail. \nFor this kind of deal, he and his business partner (who happens to be his mother Suzanne) can afford to fly all over the Gulf for fittings.\nWith steady business from clients in the Gulf (his team of 43 in-house staff have deadlines for 30 dresses this month alone), Jabotian is now looking to the rest of the region -- and world. \n\"When we dressed Queen Rania [of Jordan, for a lunch with Britain's Queen Elizabeth II] it opened us up to the Jordan weddings market,\" he recalls with glee. \"We also just got our first client in France, one in the UK, one in Singapore, as well as a few in Panama.\"\nKrikor Jabotian is available by appointment at his atelier in Tabaris. Arrange a meeting by calling +961 01 204 793. Wedding dresses start at $25,000; evening gowns start at $18,000.\nLara Khoury \nLara Khoury's collections are inspired, she says, by the Lebanese experience.\nOne day in the summer of 2006, Lara Khoury returned to her hometown in north Lebanon for a break from her course at the Ecole Superieure des Arts et Techniques de la Mode in Paris. \nTwo days later, the country was at war.\nAfter the July War, Khoury worked for several years in the local fashion industry before launching her own ready-to-wear label. \nEach of her five collections have been inspired, she says, by the Lebanese experience.\nPhoenix, her spring/summer 2015 collection, featuring bright, happy colors, was \"an invitation to Lebanese people to find a better future together.\"\nGluttony, the voluminous autumn/winter 2013 collection, was intended as a reprimand of the country's politicians and businessmen for their \"greed.\" \nThe latest collection, inspired by the Lebanese diaspora, features big coats that evoke the rigors of travel.\nHer collections have garnered fans, predictably, in Kuwait, Saudi and the UAE, but also in Japan -- she's sold whole collections to boutique buyers in each country. \nUp next? \n\"I'm just starting to attack the Latin American region -- it's a really exciting time,\" she says.\nLara Khoury's atelier is at 406 Gouraud Street, Gemmayzeh, across from Le Chef restaurant. Appointments can be arranged by calling +961 01 443 426. Tops start at $150, evening gowns cost up to $2,000.\nStephanie d'Arc Taylor is an American journalist who has lived in Beirut for three years working on subjects of politics, business, and arts & culture.

We need to finish what we have started. We can't  settle for less.\"\nDefending champion Real Madrid will try to set up a second successive all-Spanish title showdown on Wednesday at home to Juventus, but faces a 2-1 deficit against the Italian league winner.\nReal goalkeeper Iker Casillas is set to join Xavi Hernandez as the only player to have made 150 Champions League appearances -- the 35-year-old Barcelona midfielder reached that milestone when he came on as a second-half substitute against Bayern.\nThe final will be played in Berlin on June 6.\nWho will win the Champions League this year?

Is that to stabilize the situation or to further mess it up? The facts are out there.\"\nCui, in an interview with Chinese media in the United States on Wednesday, noted that some countries had already begun reclaiming land on reefs that Beijing says belong to China, but the United States had not singled them out.\nOn the Pentagon's plan to send military aircraft and ships to the South China Sea, Cui \"stressed that many things in the world cannot rely on a show of force to solve them and that the knee-jerk 'Cold War' mentality to use force is outdated\".\nThe senior State Department official said \"the question about what the U.S Navy does or doesn't do is one that the Chinese are free to pose\" to Kerry in Beijing, where he is due on Saturday for meetings with civilian and military leaders.\nKerry's trip is intended to prepare for the annual U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue next month in Washington  and Xi's expected visit to Washington in September. But growing strategic rivalry rather than cooperation look set to dominate.\nChina's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that freedom of navigation did not mean that foreign military ships and aircraft can enter another country's territorial waters or airspace at will.    \n\"YOU CAN'T BUILD SOVEREIGNTY\"\nThe State Department official dismissed the idea that constructing islands out of half-submerged reefs gave China any right to territorial claims. \n\"Ultimately no matter how much sand China piles on top of a submerged reef or shoal ... it is not enhancing its territorial claim. You can't build sovereignty,\" he said.\nHe said Kerry would \"reinforce ... the very negative consequences to China's image and China's relationship with its neighbors on regional stability and potentially on the U.S.- China relationship from their large-scale reclamation efforts and the behavior generally in the South China Sea.\"\nBeijing claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, through which $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei have overlapping claims.\nLast month, the U.S. military commander for Asia, Admiral Samuel Locklear, said China could eventually deploy radar and missile systems on the islands it is building in the Spratly archipelago that could be used to enforce an exclusion zone should it move to declare one. \nThe U.S. official who spoke on Tuesday said U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter had requested options that include sending aircraft and ships within 12 nautical miles (22 km) of the reefs China has been building up.\nFailure to clinch an agreement could damage Washington's leadership image in Asia, where China has been forging ahead with a new Beijing-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) seen as a challenge to U.S. global financial leadership.\n (Addtional reporting by Phil Stewart and David Alexander, and Ben Blanchard and Sui-Lee Wee in Beijing; Editing by \nEmily Stephenson\n, W Simon, \nChristian Plumb\nChris Reese\n and \nAlex Richardson", "source": "reuters", "keywords": ["china", "south china", "china sea", "beijing", "kerry", "cui"], "guid": "us-usa-china-southchinasea-idUSKBN0NY1PP"}

These are compounds that work to boost the effectiveness of existing antibiotics  - a far less costly approach than attempting to discover entirely new drugs.\nHelperby Therapeutics, a spin-out company founded by Prof Anthony Coates, St George's, University of London, has created a resistance breaker that acts against the superbug MRSA.  \nThe compound, known as HT61, will shortly go into clinical trials in India, where it is being developed under licence by Cadila Pharmaceuticals India.\nThe review team said this kind of research could benefit from the innovation fund and could be the key to making existing drugs last longer.  \nMr O'Neill said the big pharmaceutical companies should pay for the fund and look beyond short-term assessments of profit and loss.\nFormerly chief economist with the investment bank Goldman Sachs, Mr O'Neill drew parallels between the banking crisis and the looming catastrophe of a world where antibiotics no longer worked.\nInnovation funding\nMr O'Neill was speaking to the BBC's Panorama programme, which has spent six months following the work of the review team, filming in India, the US and UK. \nMr O'Neill was appointed last year by Prime Minister David Cameron to head the review into antimicrobial resistance - which already claims an estimated 30,000 lives a year across Europe.\nMany large companies have pulled out of antibiotic research.\nThe report says this is partly due to the uncertain commercial returns for new antibiotics.\nNew drugs are often kept in reserve for years, to preserve their potency, by which time they may be nearing the end of their patent.\nAfter this expires, cheaper generic versions are available.\nIn order to incentivise drug development, the review team says, there should be lump-sum payments to companies that create proven new antibiotics.\nThis would break the link between the profitability of a drug and its volume of sales.\nThe review team predicts its proposals could lead to 15 new antibiotics a decade, of which at least four should be \"breakthrough products\" targeting the bacterial species of greatest concern.\nIt estimates the cost of guaranteed payments for these drugs would be $16-37bn over a decade but says this is a small price to pay given that antibiotics are essential to so many aspects of healthcare, from common infections, to surgery and cancer treatment.\nUS breakthrough\n\n                        A new drug, effective against tuberculosis and MRSA, should be trialled on patients within two years\n                    \nIt is nearly 30 years since a new class of antibiotics - meaning a group of drugs with an entirely novel action - was introduced.\nBut this decades-long drought could be over as a result of a breakthrough recently announced by US scientists.\nA team at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, \nhas discovered 25 potential new antibiotics\n, all of them derived from soil microbes.\nOne of them, teixobactin, is effective against both tuberculosis and MRSA.\nThe drug is being developed by NovoBiotic Pharmaceuticals and should go into patient trials within two years.\nProf Kim Lewis, of Northeastern University, who co-founded the company, told Panorama:  \"We think there could be thousands more antibiotics in the soil, yet to be discovered.\"\n\n                        The team at Northeastern University created a device to help them study the bacteria\n                    \nThere are still many uncertainties.  \nTeixobactin has yet to undergo patient trials, and it is at this stage that many promising drugs fail.\nNor is it effective against bacteria such as E.coli and Klebsiella, which are responsible for a huge proportion of resistant infections.\nBut the Boston team's discoveries are the type of innovative research many scientists believe essential to ensure we do not run out of effective antibiotics.\nPatrick Vallance, GlaxoSmithKline's president of pharmaceutical R&D said that, as one of the few companies still conducting antibiotic research they welcomed the report: \"We are very encouraged by the ideas it sets out to modernise the economic model to encourage investment in research and ensure reasonable returns.\"\nProf Dame Sally Davies,  chief medical adviser to the UK government, said: \"We have to respond to the challenge of antimicrobial resistance by making sure we secure the necessary antibiotics for generations to come, in order to save millions of lives and billions of pounds.\" \nPanorama: Antibiotic Apocalypse is on Monday 18 May on BBC ONE at 20:30 BST or you can catch up on\niPlayer. \n Superbugs to kill 'more than cancer' by 2050 \n11 December 2014\n Antibiotic resistance: Cameron warns of medical 'dark ages' \n2 July 2014\n Antibiotics resistance 'as big a risk as terrorism' -

Tongo/Pool/Files\n3 of 3\nright\nTOKYO\nThe effort centers on a first-of-its-kind conference between the Marine Corps and military officials from 23 countries that opens in Hawaii on Monday. More than half the nations attending are from Asia, including some embroiled in territorial disputes with China such as Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam.\nOn the agenda will be amphibious assault tactics, including ship-to-shore assaults, and a demonstration of shore landing tactics, said a USMC spokesman in Hawaii. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A planning document prepared by a consultant to the U.S. military and reviewed by Reuters notes that China should \"not be invited\" because it's a \"competitor\" to the United States and some of the countries attending.\nWashington has grown increasingly critical of China's assertiveness in the disputed South China Sea, especially its land reclamation around seven reefs in the Spratly chain. Satellite images show at least one airstrip under construction.\nA U.S. official said on Tuesday that the Pentagon was considering sending U.S. military aircraft and ships to assert freedom of navigation around the reefs.\nAsked about China's exclusion, the Marine spokesman said U.S. law prohibited military-to-military exchanges with China at such events. \nU.S. defense officials added that it was not unusual to exclude Chinese military personnel from participating in some training hosted by U.S. forces. \nChina's Defence Ministry had no immediate comment.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that any country had the right to invite who it wanted to a meeting or event, as long as it was beneficial for maintaining regional peace and stability.\n\"The militaries of China and the United States have normal exchanges and cooperation on various levels,\" Hua told a daily news briefing.\nBEACH LANDINGS\nAmphibious forces specialize in launching maritime operations including beach landings from boats and helicopters and are often used to deliver and coordinate aid following natural disasters. The vast island-dotted and disaster-prone geography of Asia lends itself to such operations.\nA key goal of the Hawaii meeting would be to lay the groundwork for multilateral amphibious exercises, including drills between participant nations, even without U.S. involvement, the planning document said.\nOn Tuesday, the visiting military officials will observe a U.S. Marine exercise involving helicopter carriers, landing ships and other vessels that will create an offshore sea base that could be used in combat or to coordinate disaster relief.\n\"My inclination would be to start with a relatively realistic level of ambition ... I would rather set a low bar and achieve it,\" Spencer told Reuters on the sidelines of a defense conference in the Japanese city of Yokohama.\nThe U.S. Marines were the \"logical integrator\" for amphibious capabilities in Asia, which would interest allies like Japan, South Korea and Australia, said Michael Green, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\"(It would) also be helpful to other partners dealing with vulnerabilities from natural disasters to encroachment and coercion by large maritime claimants,\" he said.\nChina claims most of the South China Sea. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also claim parts of the waterway.\nChina last month defended its Spratlys reclamation, saying the new islands would provide civilian services such as search and rescue facilities.\nBeijing is also at loggerheads with Japan over uninhabited isles in the East China Sea.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHARLEM GLOBETROTTERS?\nU.S. military planners are concerned that bilateral exercises between American forces and friendly nations around Asia have done little more than show off the U.S. Marines.\nWith some 80,000 personnel or almost half its strength in Asia, the U.S. Marines are the biggest amphibious force in the region. Most are based on Japan's Okinawa island on the edge of the East China Sea.\nWith around 12,000 marines, China is a formidable potential foe, say military experts. \nCountries in dispute with China over territory in the South China Sea don't have large amphibious forces.\nTwo late entrants to amphibious warfare training are close U.S. allies: Australia and Japan.\u00a0\nAustralia last year launched the Canberra, the first of two planned amphibious ships, each able to land 1,000 troops. Japan, which under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is pursuing a more muscular defense policy, is training its first marines since World War Two. \nMelding an integrated amphibious force in Asia able to divide tasks between nations and operate seamlessly would take time, said Ben Schreer, senior defense strategy analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\n\"The challenges are military complexity, capability standards, limited funding, competing priorities and, in some cases, overlapping claims in the South China Sea,\" he said.\n (Additional reporting by \nDavid Alexander\n and \nPhil Stewart\n in WASHINGTON, and \nBen Blanchard\n in BEIJING; Editing by \nDean Yates", "source": "reuters", "keywords": ["china", "amphibious", "china sea", "military", "japan", "philippines"], "guid": "us-usa-marines-asia-idUSKBN0NZ07J"}

Rain comes mainly between June to September and much runs off from the parched fields, taking topsoil with it.\nSimple water management infrastructure, including rainwater storage facilities and irrigation dykes, like the ones young men are building in Djimebougou, play a crucial role, residents said. Green grass sprouts on the side of the wall where water is kept but a few feet away is dusty brown sand.\nFinanced by the World Food Programme (WFP), the work-for-aid project gives local men some money before planting season. \n\"Water is the stepping stone for any other activity,\" WFP's Mark Sauveur told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nOnce villagers have regular water, they can create vegetable gardens, keep their animals healthy and replant trees, he said.\nDeforestation, which can make rainfall more erratic, is a big problem in the village, one being addressed with the introduction of clay stoves, which villagers can build themselves with local clay and a donated steel mold.\nThe stoves halve a family's need for firewood.\n\"Now that we don't have to cut as much wood, we can spend more time growing our vegetable gardens,\" said Daly Sacko, head of the town's women's committee. \nDWINDLING RAIN\nSacko said he began seeing the impact of global warming 15 years ago with changed precipitation patterns and less rain.\nAs their harvests failed, many Djimebougou residents planned to move to cities or the capital Bamako in search of work but where they were likely to swell the ranks of the urban jobless.\nBut Sacko said interventions to shore up water supplies and provide jobs helped prevent large-scale migration.\nLike other towns across North Africa, Djimebougou faces a high rate of population growth with Mali recording the world's second highest birth rate behind Niger, according to U.S. data. The average Malian woman has more than six children and that always makes it a challenge to grow enough food.\nAcross the Sahel, food production is not keeping pace with population growth, according to an October study from Sweden's Lund University. \nIn 22 arid countries in Africa's Sahel and north, the population has risen 30 percent in a decade to 471 million in 2010, one of the fastest growth rates in the world.\nLACK OF INVESTMENT?\nDespite a fast growing population and expanding deserts, some analysts believe Mali has the capacity to feed itself.\n\"Mali should be self-sufficient in food,\" said Souleymane Coulibaly, a technical advisor to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\nCoulibaly, who regularly visits remote farming communities, blames a lack of government investment in basic infrastructure \u2013 such as the dykes and gardens of Djimebougou - for leaving an estimated 1.8 million Malians hungry.\nA focus on exporting cotton, shea nuts and other commodities to be refined elsewhere doesn't help, he said.\n\"It's not normal that Mali should import rice,\" he said, referring to irrigated farmland near the Niger River.\nMalian officials concede conditions are far from ideal, but say they are working hard to support small-scale farmers who make up 80 percent of the country's workforce. \n\"We are aware there is less and less rain,\" Aboumediane Toure, director of the Ministry of Rural Development, said in an interview. \"That's why we have been working to master and manage the water from rivers (with new irrigation plans).\"\nThe central government invited local authorities in Djimebougou to submit a \"wish list\" of infrastructure projects and villagers requested help building communal gardens but nothing came of it, said Sacko.\nInstead most of the work has been left to NGOs and U.N. organizations, he said.\n\"It's dry now, so we are working to be ready for when the rains come,\" Sacko said. \"Things have changed a lot in the past years, now that we have the gardens and dykes.\"\n (Reporting by Chris Arsenault; Editing by \nLaurie Goering\n and \nBelinda Goldsmith", "source": "reuters", "keywords": ["mali", "djimebougou", "sacko", "water", "gardens", "food"], "guid": "us-food-climatechange-mali-idUSKBN0NZ08V"}

However, the golf program had been phased out by 2000.\nKim returned to coach the team when it was reformed earlier this year with a view to competing at the Military World Games, which Korea will host in October.\nHowever, the team's future beyond the Games is in doubt, despite pulling in sponsorship and receiving backing from the local golf community.\nShould the plug be pulled, the players would have to return to regular soldier duties -- defending the nation, perhaps even at the world's most heavily armed border. \n\"My wish is that we get good results and that will be the turning point to convince people that Sangmu needs a golf team,\" Kim added. \n\"That is one of the reasons why we are training hard, so that junior golfers will be able to continue to play when they go into the military.\"\nPrivate Hur In-hoi is doing all he can to keep the golf team from going out of bounds.\nHur's victory in the 2015 Korean Tour's opening event, the Dongbu Insurance Promi Open, was met with a flurry of media attention, and photos of the stony-faced golfer saluting with one hand and holding the trophy in the other were plastered across sports pages.\nHur was unable to keep any of the prize money but said just being allowed to compete on the professional tour as a soldier was \"glorious\".\n\"All the Sangmu players are just so thankful to be here,\" Hur told Reuters by telephone. \nPark Hyo-won, who finished runner-up at the Promi Open, pocketed a cool 80 million won ($74,000). As a private in the army, Hur earns around $130 per month.\nWith the golf unit's future still up in the air, Hur said he would simply do his best in the Sangmu team regardless of whether it had any impact on the decision-making process.\n\"I'm a soldier, and solders obey orders,\" he added. \"I've been ordered to go to the Military World Games and score well so all my focus is on that. The other tournaments I take part in are just practise for the Games.\n\"When the Military Games are over I will have to obey orders, so I cannot rule out the possibility of being sent back to the regular army.\"\nGOLDEN TICKET\nFor South Korea's top athletes, success can be an avenue to bypass military service altogether.\nRecognizing the prestige success in the international sporting arena brings, the government dangles the carrot of military exemptions for Asian Games gold medalists and athletes who bring back a medal of any color from the Olympics.\nLee Dae-taek, professor at Kookmin University's Department of Physical Education, says that while military service is an integral part of South Korea's defense, how the system is applied in the sporting environment needs to be revisited.\n\"The Sangmu teams were being formed in the 70s and 80s and at the time they were effective and played their part,\" Lee told Reuters in an interview. \n\"But the times have changed and in modern society the Sangmu teams have their limits. We need other advantages (for athletes) as well as the Sangmu system.\"\nIn some ways, sport actually benefits from the military service requirement, he added.\nLike golden tickets to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, the tantalizing prospect of winning an exemption from military service can spur athletes to greater achievements at Olympic and Asian Games, said Lee.\nWhile military service is seen as a rite of passage for most South Korean men, others go to great lengths to avoid it.\nAttempting to manipulate various health and nationality clauses, some renounce citizenship or fake a debilitating illness.

I think it is changing through the project we are conducting.\n\"[We will be asking multi-nationals] where is your turnover, where are your profits, where are your employees, where do you pay your taxes? This information will be collected by all the countries - that is a game changer.\"\nRules\nThe technology companies say that it is for governments to decide how they tax businesses, not them, and that they have not broken tax rules.\nThat is an opinion Mr Saint-Amans has some sympathy with.\nI ask him whether the problem has actually been created by the policymakers rather than the companies themselves.\n\"We didn't update the rules. We unfortunately needed a crisis to have this wake-up call to say we need to change because it is outdated.\n\"Now, governments have decided to move. It shows that when you have political support you can achieve technical changes.\"\n\"We have moved from a world where we were so good at eliminating double taxation with tax treaties and transfer pricing rules that we have facilitated double non-taxation.\n\"[But] we need to be balanced. Double taxation is bad [and] multiple taxation is worse because that will harm cross-border investment. And that is what we need, for growth and for employment.\"\nThe OECD says that tax competition to encourage investment is fine. Smaller countries such as Ireland and larger countries such as the UK, with low corporation tax rates, have used it to their advantage.\n\"The problem we face today is not the low rate in Ireland, or the low rate in the UK,\" Mr Saint-Amans said.\n\"It is the fact that you have $2trn of accumulated profit of US companies located where? In Bermuda or the Cayman Islands - there is no activity there.\"\nAnd that has to stop?\n\"Absolutely.\"\nMore Business stories", "source": "bbc", "keywords": ["tax", "saint amans", "saint", "companies", "rules", "taxation"], "guid": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32730305"}

Smith, Elder, and Co. London. 1873.\nIt would not be easy to discover a greater contrast than that presented by the respective methods of our two foremost living poets. While Mr. Tennyson, straying further and further away from the living spirit of his own times, lingers contentedly in his chosen land of the Lotophagi, the realm of Arthurian romance, from which he occasionally sends us a few strains of cloying sweetness, variations on the old well-worn theme, Mr. Browning labours under the opposite defect of being too intensely and fervently contemporaneous.\nIt is only an age whose activities are harmonious and consistent, either because a temporary perfection of development has been reached or from the predominance of some one powerful influence, that can hope to find sympathetic expression in an art at all adequate or perfect. He who, like Mr. Browning, seeks to give voice to the thoughts of a time of spiritual turmoil and confusion can produce nothing which will not partake of the broken and perturbed character of the medium in which he works, and be consequently so far, artistically speaking, defective. \nIn his present poem the connection of the queer title and the prologue with the real subject is, as usual, rather historical than artistic. It represents certain casual suggestions and associations in the author\u2019s train of thought, not any relevancy of matter. We are first to imagine ourselves with Mr. Browning and a friend in some \u201csleepy hollow\u201d of a Norman village. As the two contemplate the drowsy peacefulness of the land, the friend names the land \u201cwhite cotton nightcap country.\u201d This friend, by the way, we may guess to be \nMiss Thackeray\n, to whom the work is inscribed, and to whose graceful style the following graceful lines may be thought to refer in appropriate compliment:-\nIn one of those small books the truly great\nWe never know enough, yet know so well.\nHow I foresee the cursive diamond dints -\nComposite pen that plays the pencil too -\nAs touch the page, and up the glamour goes,\nAnd filmily o\u2019er grain crop, meadow ground,\nO\u2019er orchard, in the pasture, farm a-field,\nAnd hamlet on the road edge, floats and forms\nAnd falls, at lazy last of all, the cap\nThat crowns the country.\nThat the moral of this queer and ghastly tale is not the obvious one suggested in the prologue is of course tolerably clear. Some may take Mr. Browning\u2019s purpose to have been simply to give a study in morbid psychology. We must confess, however, that we do not understand the mixture of coarse and mean sensuality, refined self-culture, passionate devotion, warm affection, fervent fanaticism that he has presented us in his hero. We cannot find, on the one hand, clear analysis; nor, on the other, artistic symmetry of delineation.\nMan and woman when they love their best,\nClosest and tenderest,\nThis is an edited extract, \nread on", "source": "guardian", "keywords": ["browning"], "guid": "http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/14/robert-browning-poem-review-1873"}

A rustle in the bushes, the wind in the leaves, a distant animal cry. Just as we\u2019re about to give up, the sound we\u2019ve been waiting for fills the inky sky.\nIt\u2019s not a lion\u2019s roar, nor a hyena\u2019s squeal, but the sweet liquid trill of a nightingale\u2026 I am on safari, but it\u2019s not the African bush. This is the \nKnepp Castle estate\n in deepest, darkest West Sussex, home to the largest rewilding project in lowland Europe.\n\u201cThe males migrate here from Africa first and they\u2019re calling to the females to let them know where they are,\u201d Charlie Burrell, owner of the estate, tells us as four more birds join the chorus. \u201cPopulations have declined by 90% in the UK in the past 40 years \u2013 but here we\u2019ve got a growing number.\u201d\nPinterest\nThe 3,500-acre Knepp estate has been in Charlie\u2019s family for more than 200 years (the John Nash castle at its heart is still the family home) and was intensively farmed until 14 years ago, when, disillusioned by the impossible economics of farming on heavy clay, he decided to let the land go back to the wild. A mosaic of ever-changing landscapes slowly emerged, and a free-roaming Big Five, comprising English longhorn cattle, red and fallow deer, Exmoor ponies and Tamworth pigs (proxies for the auroch, elk and boar that lived here thousands of years ago) are driving the expanding biodiversity.\nRelated: \nGreat country walks: Slindon Folly, West Sussex\nWe listen again to the enchanting nightingale, then climb into the 4x4 to head back to camp. Stopping at a pond en route, a detector picks up the sound of \nDaubenton\u2019s bats\n: they look like giant moths skimming the water. Rabbit tails flash white in the torchlight.

Charlie\u2019s inspiration came from a trip he made in the 1990s to \nOostvaardersplassen\n, a nature reserve and rewilding project in the Netherlands, where he saw the potential for a similar scheme in Sussex. The process was long: 250 miles of fences were removed, the river Adur returned to its natural path, wildflowers and grass sown, and scrub allowed to grow before grazing animals were introduced. Meat is still produced, but the beasts now play a conservation role, driving habitat and soil restoration.\nPinterest\n\nThe communal Go Down\n\nAs we stroll, a couple of roe deer peer at us inquisitively then skip elegantly into the woods. A solitary longhorn meanders past. The sun starts to rise \u2013 a red stripe glowing across the misty horizon. We climb to a hide above a pond that could be an African watering hole, and the sky is alive with birds singing their hearts out: cuckoo, song thrush, wren, willow warbler \u2026 Butterflies are abundant at Knepp, too \u2013 it\u2019s one of two UK breeding hotspots for purple emperors.\nVisitors (whether staying overnight or not) can join expert-led dawn, dusk, or half-day safaris. There are also specialist safaris, to view nightingales in spring, bees in summer and rutting stags in autumn. It\u2019s not obligatory to sign up for a safari \u2013 there are plenty of walks and pubs to enjoy \u2013 but it seems a shame not to learn more about the land you\u2019re camping on.\nPinterest\nRelated: \nLet\u2019s go to \u2026 the South Downs, Sussex\nOur early-bird safari finishes at the 16th-century Cow Barn with tea and bacon butties by the woodburner.

This summer, local organic lager and cider will be on sale, too.\nAs I stand outside my hut, sad to be leaving for the city, I think what I\u2019ll miss most is the overwhelming sound of the birds and a kind of tangible natural energy.

The company clearly makes use of advanced batteries in its existing lineup of devices, including the iPhone and Apple Watch. The new MacBook, for instance, uses a scalloped battery design to help it fit more power into its unique, tapered shell.

A123\u2019s ex-staff contributed to that round of rumor-fueling, but things have been subsequently relatively quiet on that front.\nThe details of this settlement between Apple and A123 were not disclosed, but it follows unsuccessful attempts by Apple to have the case thrown out. A123 Systems also filed for bankruptcy back in 2012, and has been liquidating its assets in order to help return to solvency. We\u2019ll likely never find out exactly what transpired here in terms of the details of the settlement, but Apple is probably just happy more information about their plans for the five engineers hired away from A123 didn\u2019t come to light.\nApple declined to comment when contacted by TechCrunch.", "source": "techcrunch", "keywords": ["a123", "apple", "battery", "details settlement"], "guid": "http://techcrunch.com/?p=1157942"}

Scheduling meetings has been a pain point for years, and popular calendar app \nSunrise\n is tackling this issue with a new feature called \n. This is the first major release following Sunrise\u2019s \nacquisition by Microsoft\nCo-founder and CEO Pierre Valade first told me about Meet more than a year ago. It\u2019s been through many iterations before the team finally settled for an interesting design choice. Meet is a third-party keyboard for both Android and iOS that lets you pick time slots and send them to someone without ever leaving your current app.\nI\u2019ve been following a few of Meet\u2019s iterations, and it\u2019s been an interesting product case study. At first, the company thought Sunrise needed chatting features to make an efficient scheduling tool. How can you pick a place and time that works for two people without talking? But people won\u2019t switch from Gmail, WhatsApp or iMessage, so the team had to abandon this idea.\nFor a while, Meet was a brand new app as well. When you launched the app, you were presented with a full screen calendar. In just a few taps, you could pick a few time slots, a contact name and send a meeting request. At the time, Valade told me that users shouldn\u2019t have to use a keyboard to schedule a meeting.\nBut iOS 8 introduced a feature that could prove particularly useful for Sunrise Meet \u2014 third party keyboards. The final version of meet is a calendar bundled in your keyboard. And it works incredibly well.\nHere\u2019s how it works. Let\u2019s say you are reading an email and someone wants to meet you. You hit reply, type your response and then switch to the Sunrise keyboard. You pick time slots that work for you in your calendar, and hit done. Sunrise will generate a link and add it to your email. And it works exactly the same way in your favorite messaging app or in any other app.\nIf you don\u2019t use Sunrise, the company doesn\u2019t force you to install any app. You can just confirm the meeting from your web browser, and you then receive a calendar invite in your email inbox. While everything happens in your browser, the experience is much better than using \nDoodle\nFinally, meeting suggestions update in real time, meaning that every time you book a meeting on a previously available slot, this slot will disappear from your availabilities. It\u2019s transparent for the recipient.\nOverall, the user experience is very polished and easy to use. It integrates very well with your calendar, and I can\u2019t wait to use it for all my meetings. It isn\u2019t a tool to boost the company\u2019s growth as the company clearly doesn\u2019t worry as much about it now that Microsoft acquired the New York-based startup for \n$100 million\n, according to TechCrunch\u2019s sources.\nWhile the experience doesn\u2019t work as well on the desktop, Meet is also available in Sunrise\u2019s web app and desktop app. Today\u2019s news also means that Microsoft is committed to Sunrise, and existing users can still expect regular updates for their calendar app.\n1-keyboard\n2-time-selection\n3-location-picker\n4-event-duration\n5-meet-done\n6-meet-invite\n7-meet-pick-time\n8-meet-confirm\n9-meet-confirmed\nView Slideshow\nPrevious", "source": "techcrunch", "keywords": ["sunrise", "meet", "calendar", "app", "pick time", "keyboard", "time slots"], "guid": "http://techcrunch.com/?p=1157569"}

The opinions expressed are his own.)\nMark Miller\nCHICAGO\n (Reuters) - With bond markets in turmoil, what is a 401(k) investor to do? Probably not much.\nRetirement investors have enjoyed the best of both worlds these past two years: a bull market in both equities and bonds. But the bond market has been weathering volatility and sharp declines since late April, with prices falling and yields rising. \nBond experts are not certain that the bond party is over yet, but the recent volatility raises a question: should 401(k) investors take steps to protect themselves in the event of a sharp spike in interest rates and accompanying fall in bond valuations?\n\"If investors stay course and their holding period is longer than the fund's duration, rising rates should be not much to fear,\" says Fran Kinniry, a principal in Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group.\nKinniry adds that the enduring low-rate environment has led retirement investors to change their view of the role bonds play in their portfolios. For a very long time, they saw bonds as an asset class delivering yield. But with such a low rate environment, the real role of bonds is to truncate or reduce equity risk, especially for older investors and retirees, who still may have 30 or 40 percent of their assets in equities.\nAs a result, retirement investors have taken the recent bond market volatility in stride. \"We're not seeing any real dramatic cash flow out of fixed income,\" Kinniry says. \nAutomation is another key factor reducing the drama of the bond market's volatility.\nTDFs weight younger investors' portfolios heavily toward equities, and that is reflected in overall market data. Just 5 percent of all 401(k) assets held by participants in their 20s were in bond funds in 2013, according to the most recent data from the Investment Company Institute (ICI). By contrast, 11.6 percent of assets held by account-holders in their 60s were in bond funds.\nBut TDFs, and other managed account services, also aim to improve the behavioral aspects of retirement investing, removing the inclination to react to sharp price swings or to time the market.\u00a0ICI reports that 71 percent of 401(k) plans offered TDFs in 2013, and that 41 percent of account-holders had at least some assets in them. \nKeeping funds balanced leads to positive results.

That provided coverage in a number of major markets, including\u00a0New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Francisco, Boston, Detroit, Minneapolis, Miami, Denver, Sacramento, Pittsburgh and Baltimore.\nBut the company said that the\u00a0larger plan was to bring its affiliate stations into the fold in the future. Earlier this month, CBS \nannounced\nToday, CBS is says it has\u00a0now added another 13 additional affiliates on top of the 12 added in April and the initial 14 CBS-owned stations. Combined, that brings the live, linear TV feeds to 64% of U.S. households, covering 94 markets in total.\nToday\u2019s additions bring in several notable\u00a0markets, including\u00a0Seattle, Raleigh-Durham, San Diego, Oklahoma City, Santa Barbara, Wilmington, Palm Springs and Wichita. The previous 12, meanwhile, saw the live TV service going online in many mid-sized markets like\u00a0Atlanta, Phoenix, Orlando, Cleveland, Columbus, St. Louis, Charlotte, Hartford, Kansas City and Las Vegas.\nCBS doesn\u2019t disclose the number of subscribers it has for CBS All Access, which is $5.99 per month\u00a0and offers access to nearly 7,000 episodes of CBS programming which can be streamed online at CBS.com, via mobile apps for iOS and Android, via its Roku channel, and \nnow, Chromecast\n, too. The subscription service provides on-demand access to current seasons and past seasons of popular CBS shows, like \n and \nBlue Bloods\n, as well as older programs\u00a0like \nCSI:Miam\n and \nMacGyver\n. New episodes of currently airing shows arrive on the service next-day.\ndoesn\u2019t\n have the rights to stream some sporting events, like the NFL Playoff games, or other big specials,\u00a0like the \nGrammy\u2019s\n, for example.\nThe network has notably withheld from sharing much of its content with streaming services like Hulu, as it doesn\u2019t have an equity stake in the service, which is jointly owned by NBCUniversal, Fox, and Disney-ABC. That means\u00a0today, Hulu only offers back catalog CBS classics like \nI Love Lucy, Star Trek\n and \nTwin Peaks\n, for example. That has limited access to CBS programming in the on-demand world. And CBS just previewed\u00a0at its\u00a0upfront presentation yesterday a new drama \nSupergirl\n\u00a0that could be a potential hit and a draw for its streaming service.\nWith CBS All Access, the idea is to share the revenue from the subscription fee with the affiliate stations in exchange for their live feeds \u2013 something that sets it apart from the other on-demand services available today. It\u2019s basically a hybrid of a true on-demand service like Netflix combined with\u00a0a live TV streaming service like Dish\u2019s Sling TV.\nCBS says it\u2019s still in the process of bringing on affiliates, which indicates that its plan is to eventually offer live TV feeds for most of the U.S.", "source": "techcrunch", "keywords": ["cbs", "live tv", "service", "feeds", "tv", "demand", "streaming", "stations"], "guid": "http://techcrunch.com/?p=1157958"}

Discuss.\nThe question, which has exercised Beatles fans since the song appeared in the seminal 1967 album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", could soon form part of an exam curriculum for British teenagers.\nExam board AQA, which sets and marks papers for about half of all GCSE exams taken by British 16-year-old high-school pupils, plans to introduce three songs from Sgt. Pepper into the music curriculum from September 2016.\n\"Pop music began in this country with The Beatles in the swinging sixties, so what better band to look to for the study of contemporary music than the Fab Four,\" said Seb Ross, head of AQA's music department.\nThe addition of the Sgt. Pepper tracks to the board's music GCSE curriculum puts The Beatles in the company of classical composers Joseph Haydn and Aaron Copland as well as influential guitarist Carlos Santana, whose works also feature.\nAQA said students would be asked to look at the melody, harmony, structure, rhythm and meaning of three songs from the Beatles album, which influenced generations of musicians and changed recording techniques.\n\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" has long been the subject of disagreement between those who say the title's letters refer to the psychedelic drug LSD and those who accept John Lennon's more innocent explanation.\nLennon always maintained that the song was inspired by a drawing by his five-year-old son Julian about a schoolfriend called Lucy.\nThe other two songs to be included are \"Within You, Without You\" and \"With a Little Help from My Friends\".\nThis prompted Times newspaper columnist Daniel Finkelstein to suggest the following multiple choice question, which might cause dismay among fans of drummer Ringo Starr, who performed the lead vocals in With a Little Help.\nA.

Make me the lead vocalist on one of your most famous songs?\n (Reporting by Estelle Shirbon)", "source": "reuters", "keywords": ["beatles", "music", "lucy", "songs", "sky diamonds", "sgt pepper", "curriculum", "aqa"], "guid": "us-britain-beatles-idUSKBN0NZ1J8"}

Some said he was no longer running the group and others suggested he had even died.\nIn the recording, issued by the group's al-Furqan media outlet and posted on several websites, a voice sounding like Baghdadi's says: \n\"There is no excuse for any Muslim not to migrate to the Islamic State ... Joining (its fight) is a duty on every Muslim.  We are calling on you either join or carry weapons (to fight) wherever you are.\" \nIn the message, Baghdadi tells the rulers of Saudi Arabia, who he considers his enemies, that \"their end is near\", adding that Gulf rulers felt threatened by the growing popularity of his group among Sunni Muslims.\n\"They have lost their so-called legitimacy ... When they felt that their masters, the Crusaders and the Jews, have replaced them with the Rafeda they launched their so-called war against Rafeda in Yemen,\" he said, using a derogatory term for Shi'ite Muslims. \nSaudi Arabia heads a coalition of Gulf and Arab nations fighting Shi'ite Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n Islamic State considers all those who oppose it to be infidels.\nThe group has faced military setbacks in Iraq when Iraqi forces including Shi'ite paramilitaries retook the city of Tikrit in the first big counter-offensive since Islamic State rapidly seized swathes of territory last year.\nBut the militants have struck back at the oil-producing town of Baiji and in the western province of Anbar where its move on the provincial capital of Ramadi displaced thousands of people.\nBaghdadi called on those who left Ramadi to return, saying: \"You are our people, we will defend you ... We want your safety and security.\"\nWith the United States conducting air strikes against Islamic State positions, reports have circulated that Baghdadi had been seriously wounded and had handed leadership over to a deputy.\n Baghdadi has issued several audio message since he declared the Islamic State but appeared in only one video right after his group seized the Iraqi city of Mosul last year. He was filmed giving a sermon in one of the city's mosques with several of his commanders sitting in the front row.\nBut fighters from his group told Reuters they frequently saw him in battlefields, leading the fight or checking on his soldiers. He was wounded in a battle in Syria last year.\nAt the end of his message Baghdadi saluted Islamic State loyalists in several countries including Egypt.\n\"You soldiers of the Islamic State stay steadfast ... Your enemy (the Shi'ite) is drained and today it is weaker than yesterday. It is also becoming weaker and weaker and you are becoming strong.\"\n (Additional reporting by Ali Abdelatti in Cairo; Editing by \nRobin Pomeroy\n and \nJames Dalgleish", "source": "reuters", "keywords": ["baghdadi", "islamic state", "shi", "ite", "weaker", "audio"], "guid": "us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-idUSKBN0NZ28B"}

But after seven weeks focusing their efforts around the area where the sounds were heard, searchers \ndiscounted the notion\n that the pings had come from the missing plane's black boxes.\nWATCH: Where on plane is debris potentially from?\nConflicting theories\nIn the absence of any firm answers, \ncompeting theories have surfaced\n as to what led to the plane's mysterious disappearance along a circuitous flight route.\nOne theory is that one of the pilots may have incapacitated the other, then deliberately taken the plane down in an act of pilot murder-suicide -- a nightmarish scenario that would subsequently become a reality in the Germanwings crash of March 2015.\nSome have suggested that a guest in the cockpit could have commandeered or hijacked the plane, although the lack of any claim of responsibility makes this less likely. While others argue a more conventional explanation, such as mechanical failure, is more likely.\nREAD MORE: Theories on what happened to MH370\nCNN's David Molko, Euan McKirdy, Ben Brumfeld, Michael Martinez and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.", "source": "cnn", "keywords": ["plane", "mh370", "indian ocean", "malaysian", "flight", "southern indian", "arc", "debris", "disappearance", "theories", "sea"], "guid": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/30/asia/mh370-things-to-know/index.html"}

There is a tight selection of US bottles, such as Flying Dog, Anchor, and Sierra Nevada but the Architect also operates as a brewery tap for Cambridge micro Calverley\u2019s. Its hoppy pale Supper Club was in good form, and with Titanic stout, Pilsner Urquell and Maisels Weisse wheat beer also available on keg, this is a decent, one-pint stop-off for the passing craft drinker. Despite it being a Greene King pub, the Architect\u2019s sister outlet, \nThe Alex\n, also carries cask beers from local and regional breweries such as BlackBar and Wolf, as well as Brewdog beers on keg.\nPint from \u00a33.40, 43 Castle Street, 01223 563779, \nthearchitectcambridge.co.uk\nThe Cambridge Blue\nPinterest\n The Elm Tree\nPint from \u00a33.20, 85-87 Gwydir Street, 01223 471680, \nthe-cambridgeblue.co.uk\nCambridge Wine Merchants\u2019 Bridge Street Wine Bar and Hot Numbers\nPinterest\n\nPhotograph: Alamy\n\nHot Numbers\n, also carries a number of bottled craft beers (from \u00a33.70). Staples from Kernel and Brooklyn are augmented by guests such as Tiny Rebel\u2019s excellent F.U.B.A.R and the Panty stout from Dutch brewer Oedipus. \n31 Bridge Street, 01223 568989, \nThe Cambridge Brew House\nPinterest\nThe Mill\n, was recently been named pub of the year by the local Camra group. \nPint from \u00a33.50, 1 King Street, 01223 855185, \nMaypole\nTucked away off Portugal Place, the Maypole\u2019s quirky covered terrace \u2013 which has its own dedicated serving hatch \u2013 is a great place to swerve the tourist hordes on a sunny day. Beer-wise, the pub stocks a core of mainline US craft and Icelandic Einstock bottles; a high-quality selection of Belgian brews; and, on keg, the likes of Camden Pale, Lagunitas IPA and, on this occasion, Crystal Rye IPA - one of Adnam\u2019s so-so attempts at craft. The pub\u2019s 16 cask beers are more traditional, but you will find some notables in there from local breweries, such as Moonshine and Colchester Brewery, as well as new-wave guest beers from, for instance, Manchester\u2019s TicketyBrew and Yorkshire\u2019s Summer Wine. \nPint from \u00a33.80, 20a Portugal Place, 01223 352999, \nmaypolefreehouse.co.uk\nPint Shop\nA rather hip bar by Cambridge standards (there is lots of wood panelling, industrial lighting, vintage-looking brass taps on the bar), Pint Shop specialises in cutting-edge craft beers. Its 10 keg and six cask lines were, on this visit, pouring beers from Arbor, Thornbridge, Redemption, Redwell and Dutch brewery Kaapse, as well as an intriguing Imperial India Brown beer from Beavertown in collaboration with Canada\u2019s Bellwoods. I opted for Marble\u2019s marvellous Pint, which \u2013 lingeringly bitter, full of floral and tropical fruit flavours \u2013 was a reminder of just how much flavour a skilled brewer can pack into a 3.9% session ale. \nPint from \u00a33.80, 10 Peas Hill, 01223 352293, \npintshop.co.uk\nRhode Island & foodPark\nPinterest\nSadly, I didn\u2019t make it to this burger and craft beer joint in the suburb of Cherry Hinton (bus C3, 15mins from station), but its craft beer range speaks for itself. Its house beers are Brooklyn lager and Sierra Nevada, while its 10 ever-changing guest bottles include gems from British pace-setters such as Wild Beer, Kernel, Five Points and Cambridge-based micro BlackBar. In fact, BlackBar is currently brewing a beer with Rhode Island which will launch in May. Talking of places in Cambridge which pair street food with craft beer, the bar at the \nfoodPark Night Market\n events also serve a compact but discerning range of craft beers, including various cans from Beavertown (look out for its seasonal blood orange IPA, Bloody \u2018Ell) and at least one local beer. For instance, at the last Night Market, the bar had bottles of a pale ale brewed by Cambridge wine merchants, Cozzi & Boffa.\nBeers from \u00a33.60, 15 High Street, Cherry Hinton, 01223 778080, \nThe Grain Store\nAmong craft beer geeks, Greene King is a bit of a laughing stock. A major pub company and brewery, located in Suffolk, its IPA is regularly (and rightly) derided as not worthy of that name. Meanwhile, the beers it has released to muscle-in on the craft market have met with, at best, a lukewarm response. None of this is deterring Greene King, which has recently launched Grain Store, its first dedicated craft beer bar. Despite the graffiti and glazed brickwork, it very much feels like a corporate take on the concept and the relatively mainstream nature of the beer selection - not to mention the staff\u2019s somewhat sketchy product knowledge \u2013 is not going to turn it into a destination for craft aficionados. But, for all that, there is a certain satisfaction in seeing Greene King forced to minimise the presence of its own beers (that IPA, Noble lager) in its own pub, and, undoubtedly, the Grain Store will expose some drinkers to exciting new beers they would otherwise not have encountered. Those beers include unpasteurised tank Pilsner Urquell; several Brewdog, Red Squirrel and Black Isle keg beers; bottles from excellent US brewery, Goose Island (now distributed by Greene King in the UK), and guest cask ales from such breweries as Wolf, Potbelly, Slater\u2019s and Colchester. Looking out across the adjacent parkland of Parker\u2019s Piece, I drank a half of Brewdog\u2019s (entry-level, over-carbonated) Electric India saison and toasted a pub which, for all the caveats, feels like a victory for the craft beer movement. \nPint from \u00a33.20,\n69-76 Regent Street, 01223 323405, \ngrainstore-cambridge.co.uk\nBlue Moon\nPinterest\nIt looks a bit dismal from outside, but this student-friendly pub (Anglia Ruskin University is nearby), with its pizza oven, film nights and firm focus on craft beer, is a find. Its staff are clearly beer enthusiasts and know their hops. As promised, the Adnam\u2019s/Magic Rock collaboration, the Herbalist, did indeed taste remarkably of fresh basil. I opted instead for an old favourite, Dark Star\u2019s Hophead (\u201cThere is nothing boring about Hophead,\u201d the barman reassured me). Blue Moon\u2019s range revolves around four cask and 10 keg lines, which were dispensing, among others, Almasty\u2019s Figin Porter and Nene Valley\u2019s Big Bang Theory. It also carries a small range of bottled Weird Beard and New Zealand beers, from Renaissance, Yeastie Boys and Tuatara. Thanks to the efforts of local supplier Jolly Good Beer you see New Zealand beers more often than you expect to in Cambridge.\nPint from \u00a33.20, 2 Norfolk Street, 01223 500238, \nKingston Arms\nPinterest\nThey are a rarity in modern Britain, but the area of terraced housing around Cambridge railway station is home to several street corner and mid-terrace pubs. \nThe Alex\n (Gwydir Street), Devonshire Arms (1 Devonshire Road) and the \nLive & Let Live\n (40 Mawson Road) are all worth a visit, but it is Cambridge Blue (see separate entry) and, to a lesser extent, the Kingston Arms which really carry the flag for craft beer. The Kingston\u2019s 11 cask ales mix stalwart real ales, such as Landlord, with hop-forward creations from, say, Bristol Beer Factory, Celt, Burning Sky, Dark Star and TicketyBrew. That modern classic, Jaipur from Thornbridge, is notably one of the pub\u2019s permanent beers. As well as a small range of bottles, the Kingston\u2019s dedicated \u201ccrafty keg\u201d line serves beers from such breweries as Firebrand and Fyne & Wild. In the covered patio garden, you will also spot a stillage and bar, ready to be racked with beers for the monthly ale festivals held over summer. \nPint from \u00a32.80, 33 Kingston Street, 01223 319414, \nkingston-arms.co.uk\n Train travel between Manchester and Cambridge was provided by \nCross Country Trains", "source": "guardian", "keywords": ["beers", "beer", "craft", "pint", "cambridge", "street 01223", "pub", "greene king"], "guid": "http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/07/top-10-craft-beer-pubs-cambridge"}

Meadows in the Mountain festival in Bulgaria\nPhotograph: PR\n\nMeadows in the Mountains, Bulgaria\nWith a wild camping vibe \u2013 bonfires, small stages and bunting in the trees \u2013 Meadows in the Mountains has built a reputation over the past five years for offering a uniquely magical experience. Set in the lush environment of the Rhodope Mountains, mornings are blessed each day with a mist that glides over the landscape. The discerning line-up will pique the interest of anyone with an eye on the underground scene: Jane Fitz, Al Dobson Jr and Mo Kolours are among the headliners, while Quantic is probably the best-known name in a line-up that spans techno, house and soul. \n 12-14 June, \u00a3150, \nFestiwal Tauron Nowa Muzyka, Poland\nPinterest\n\nPhotograph: Radoslaw Kazmierczak/PR\n\nIt sounds like the plot of a horror B-movie - a group of kids hopping on to the site of an abandoned coal mine for a rave. But that\u2019s where this avant-garde music fest in the heart of Katowice will take place. Set between two mine shafts that operated from 1823 until 1999, the festival has a line-up featuring US west coast rapper Tyler the Creator, London-based neo-soul talent Fatima and Detroit techno legend Jeff Mills, who\u2019s performing with the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra. All this will happen in the old production halls, warehouses and pressure tower of the deserted industrial facility. There are also tours of the site; this year\u2019s organiser promises to make an even more unique, dystopian setting. \n 20-23 \nAugust , four-day pass \u00a355, \nfestiwalnowamuzyka.pl\nSouthern Soul Festival, Montenegro\nPinterest\nIt\u2019s straight up sun, sea and soul at this chilled-out festival on Copacabana Beach on Montenegro\u2019s Mediterranean coast. Now in its third year, the event brings over 40 acts to three stages on the vast, sandy shoreline. Expect to hear a soundtrack provided by modern soul and electronic music\u2019s most forward-thinking producers, DJs and artists. This year\u2019s line-up features in-demand digital composers Dorian Concept and Romare, as well as cutting-edge European jazz in the form of the Matthew Halsall Quintet and the Elliptics. Think of it as a musical holiday; this is one festival you\u2019ll come back from feeling refreshed. \n 25-28 June, four-day pass \u00a369, seven-day campsite pass \u00a350, \nsouthernsoulfestival.me\nMandrea Music Festival, Italy\nPinterest\nCool off up in the hilltops at this dub and reggae fest in the foothills of the stunning Dolomites range. Mad Professor and Max Romeo are the headliners of this laid-back event that\u2019s as much about exploring (and lounging around in) the peaceful surroundings as it is about the music. The festival site is by Lake Garda, a turquoise stretch of water that\u2019s the largest lake in Italy. Around it you can hike, mountain bike and rock climb, but the festival itself offers plenty of distractions, including a cinema, mini-skate park and performance workshops, while the sound systems boom in the background. Bring an airhorn. \n30 July-2 August, early-bird five-night pass \u00a357, \nFestival Yeah!, France\nPinterest\nThe baby of internationally renowned DJ and producer Laurent Garnier, Festival Yeah! is an easygoing, boutique festival in the pretty French town of Lourmarin. Don\u2019t think all-night techno party, think good times, good food and good music spent with family and friends. The line-up is predominantly a mix of indie electro, rock and folk, as well as some DJs. Garnier himself will be spinning tunes in the kids\u2019 tent. If that doesn\u2019t hook you, then the Saturday afternoon p\u00e9tanque competition, with a soundtrack provided by deep house crew collective Ol\u00e9 Ol\u00e9, surely will. \n 5-7 June, three-day pass \u00a345, \nfestivalyeah.fr\nTr\u00e6na Festival, Norway\nHelp increase massively the population of Tr\u00e6na \u2013 one of the smallest municipalities in Norway \u2013 by showing up for this annual festival on a rugged island surrounded by sparkling ocean and swooping sea eagles. All 500 citizens participate in the event, which has a programme of cutting-edge Norwegian music, including melodic electro-pop from Emilie Nicolas and rowdy beats from KUUK, whom you could safely describe as Olso\u2019s answer to stomach-churning South African rap-rave group Die Antwoord. The festival may literally be a bit too \u201cout there\u201d for most UK festival goers, but it\u2019s the perfect excuse to explore one of Europe\u2019s most dramatic and wild environments (and be able to tell your friends about that crazy band you saw on a lump of rock at the edge of the Arctic circle).\n 9-11 July, \u00a3110, \ntrena.net\nMS Dockville, Germany\nNot as well-known as Germany\u2019s other big festivals, Fusion, Hurricane or Melt!, MS Dockville is a music-and-arts party on the river island of Wilhelmsburg in Hamburg. Colourful installations and artworks dot the festival site, which is surrounded by the warehouses of the city\u2019s docks. The line-up should appeal to indie party kids worldwide. This year you\u2019ll find Interpol, Django Django, Caribou, Four Tet and Little Dragon on the bill. \n 21-23 August, \u00a370, \nmsdockville.de\nFlow Festival, Slovenia\nPinterest\nEstablished in Helsinki, over the past decade Flow has built a repuation for pushing the world\u2019s best contemporary music. This year, it travels to Slovenia for the first time, with a sister edition of the festival being held in a 19th-century factory environment in Ljubljana. The line-up doesn\u2019t let up either: Metronomy, Pet Shop Boys and Roisin Murphy top the bill, but the presence of Derrick May, \u00c2me and DJ Koze show the techno edge of the event. Just as in Helsinki, the festival will also feature visual arts, film and seminars, with a focus on modern creative culture. \n 26-28 June, three-day pass \u00a368 \nflowfestival.si\nInto the Valley, Sweden\nPinterest\n 31 July-1 August, \u00a3115, \nintothevalley.se\nParadise City, Belgium\n\nKasteel de Ribaucourt in Perk, the setting for the first Paradise City Festival, Belgium.\n\nJust outside Brussels, in the grounds of a 15th-century castle, new eco-conscious event Paradise City aims to create a \u201cgreen haven\u201d for festival-goers.

Co-designed by architects with the Pitjantjatjara community to share their Dreamtime origin stories and Tjukurpa (natural law), its lively but respectful displays make sense of the Anangu\u2019s request (ignored by many tourists) not to climb Uluru.\nInstead, we do a three-hour walk around its base, stopping at cave drawings and waterholes to learn more from our guide, Adam. The only part of the adjacent Ayers Rock resort we visit is the campsite where, after a simple supper, we roll out our swags \u2013 a sleeping bag and mattress in one. They\u2019re easy to roll up at 4.30am, when we are woken to catch the sunrise over coffee and toast served from the minibus.\nNext stop, Kata Tjuta, which is 25km to the west, and whose Dreamtime stories are so sacred to male elders that they can\u2019t be shared on our walk through its 36 marble-like domes. Rather, we get a geology lesson that\u2019s drawn in the sand and try food such as fragrant wild mint, and drink in vistas worthy of Jurassic Park.\nAs we finish our final four-hour walk at a healthy 10am, Adam jokes: \u201cYou came all this way to see two rocks and a hole?\u201d Well, yes. Plus 10,000 years of Indigenous culture, the natural wonders of a neoproterozoic age, and that eternal Northern Territory sky.\nThe Rock Tour (\n) costs AU$375 (\u00a3194) for a three-day, two-night tour, including food and camping\nNancy Groves\nCamping at Booderee national park, Jervis Bay, NSW\n\nA walkway at the entrance to Cave Beach, Booderee national park.

Just three hours south of Sydney, Jervis Bay is an enclave that belongs to the Commonwealth of \nAustralia\nThe community has been the custodian of this stretch of coast for thousands of years, and it is the thoughts of who came before us that fill our minds as we explore the caves that give the beach its name. The Dhurga can take you on a guided tour of the area, teach weaving or spend time storytelling around the campfire, while the botanic garden is the only Indigenous Australian-owned one in the country.\nCampsite fee AU$22 (around \u00a311) in summer, including entry to the national park, \nparksaustralia.gov.au/boodere\nBill Code\nTouring the Quinkan galleries\n Northern Queensland\n\nGiant Horse rock art, Quinkan, Laura. Photograph: Mark Kolbe/Getty Images\n\nParts of northern Queensland\u2019s ocre-and-red landscape are devoid of people but full of history. I\u2019m here to see the Quinkan galleries, some of the oldest rock art in the world, estimated to date back 30,000 years.\nThe art is found across 230,000 hectares of sandstone in central Queensland, four hours\u2019 drive inland from Cairns. The most accessible of it is around 30 minutes\u2019 drive from the small town of Laura, an open, sun-baked area of craggy escarpments, one that requires a hat, sunscreen and water once you venture from your vehicle\u2019s air conditioning.\nIt is on the underbelly of large rock formations that the art is displayed, some of it requiring you to peer into caves but most set out on flat, exposed rock at ground level. Wooden guardrails are in place to ensure the art isn\u2019t damaged, but you can still get close to these depictions by following a trail up a moderately steep path.\nGuided tours are available, with walks taking between 15 minutes and three hours, from the nearby town of Laura. I paid the AU$5 (\u00a32.60) honesty fee and scrambled up the rocky path myself. To the Indigenous Australian people, the Quinkans are protective spirit guides. They are depicted as spindly figures with outstretched arms, and large and owl-like eyes. Emus, ibis and various trees are also visible. The art \u2013 combined with the rocks and burnt colours, save for the flashes of sparse but vivid gum trees and grasses after the rain comes \u2013 chimes perfectly with the landscape.\nGuided tours, arranged through the \nQuinkan and Regional Cultural Centre\n in Laura, cost from AU$100 to AU$160pp (\u00a352-83).

This not only gives the lie to the belief that all \nIndigenous Australians\n were nomadic hunter-gatherers but also makes this Australia\u2019s oldest-known settlement.\n\u201cThe lake was like a giant pantry,\u201d Gunditjmara guide Ben Church tells me, as we walk among the ruins on a Budj Bim tour, \u201cand the eels were traded right across southern Australia.\u201d\nWith their population peaking at up to 10,000, Church\u2019s ancestors lived well here until the early 19th century, when colonists forced them off their land and into the Lake Condah mission. Here they were forbidden from speaking their language or practising traditional skills, such as weaving eel baskets. The story of the settlement was also suppressed, until its existence was proven by archaeologist Heather Builth, just under 20 years ago.\nVisiting this rubbly wetland with Church and Debbie Malseed, a Gunditjmara elder, I experience a sense of the thriving community that existed here and of disbelief that this part of Australia\u2019s history isn\u2019t better known.\nBudj Bim tours of Lake Condah cost from AU$50 \n(\u00a326) \nfor adults, +613 5527 1699, \nHomestay, Arnhem Land, Northern Territory\nPinterest\n\nWeaver at work, Arnhem Land.

The weaving workshops are led by elderly women who have lived in M\u00e4puru all their lives.\nIt isn\u2019t all craft. Each day the children of the community and I go swimming in the waterhole (the kids keep an eye out for crocodiles) and I\u2019m also lucky enough to accompany the women on a hunting trip; we go to the plains and shoot buffalo, which we cook up at night on the campfire in a stew.\nA group trip with Ceres (\n) costs from AU$2,000 \n(\u00a31,034)\n for nine days\nBrigid Delaney\nSail Darwin Tiwi Islands Tour, Northern Territory\n\nArt of the Tiwi people, from Bathurst and Melville Islands, Northern Territory. Photograph: Corbis\n\n\u201cI grew up visiting these islands, fishing and hunting with my Dad,\u201d guide Shannon Lee tells us as we sail to the Tiwis, around 50 miles north of Darwin. Lee, 26, is from the coastal Larrakia people, around Darwin, and accompanies us throughout a four-day tour, sharing his culture and introducing us to Tiwi people he has known since childhood.\nAfter spending our first evening watching flatback turtles laying eggs on a remote sand cay, we anchor in the lake-like Apsley Strait between the Tiwis\u2019 two inhabited islands, Bathurst and Melville, where 90% of the 3,000 population are Tiwi.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been here at least 7,000 years,\u201d says Tiwi elder Molly Munkara, who we meet, with three other local women, painting mussel shells under a wild apple tree on Bathurst Island, on our second morning.\nThis unhurried tour allows us to spend time with artists such as the acclaimed 84-year-old Connie Tipuamantumirri and potter Regis Pangiraminni, buy work straight from its creators and meet some of the island\u2019s transgender \u201csistagirls\u201d, long an accepted part of the Tiwi community.\nOn either side of going ashore, we fish for snapper and trevally as the tropical sun rises and sets in a blaze of tangerine and lilac hues and hear more about our Larrakia guide\u2019s upbringing over galley-cooked meals on board Sail Darwin\u2019s 50ft catamaran.\nSail Darwin\u2019s (\n) three-day, three-night Tiwi islands Adventure Sail costs AU$1,485 (\u00a3767) including all meals and accommodation\nTop Didj Cultural Experience Tours, Katherine, Northern Territory\nPinterest\n\nArtist Manuel Pamkal.

Using fine (jalk) brushes made from reeds, we each eventually create a turtle \u201cartwork\u201d which we take away as a souvenir.\nIt is inspiring to do something so hands-on but we also emerge with a greater appreciation for the Dalabon and their careful husbandry of the land over thousands of years, thanks to this gentle commentary provided by this passionate ambassador of his people.\nThe award-winning cultural experience ends with a chance to learn fire-lighting skills, with only grass and two types of wood, and to throw a spear using a woomera \u2013 a wooden lever that accelerates the weapon\u2019s speed \u2013 at cardboard kangaroos.\nTop Didj\u2019s Cultural Experience (\n) costs AU$70 (\u00a336) for adults and AU$45 \n(\u00a323) for \nkids (3-15).

In the summer, visitors can hike up the mountains, taking in stunning views, and in winter clip on the skis for cross-country touring. The Orco, Soana and Cogne valleys are great areas to explore, as are villages of traditional stone-built houses.

You can, however, stay overnight, for free, in the log huts dotted along the way. There are also canoeing routes through the rapids of the Oulankajoki river, as well as more easy-going, family-friendly routes to take downstream. Established in 1956, the park is known for its reindeer and its diverse mix of natural features and rare plants.

As well as being an area of natural beauty it has compelling remains of human occupation: a Roman road winds through the park, marked with 2,000-year-old milestones. Serra do Ger\u00eas is the park\u2019s most popular settlement, where you\u2019ll find pools to swim in. It\u2019s also worth noting the date of your visit: every Friday 13th, the village of Montalegre, just beyond the park\u2019s eastern border, enjoys the Noite das Bruxas, a street party fuelled by \nqueimada\n, a local liqueur drunk with honey. \nicnf.pt\nSaxon Switzerland, Germany\nPinterest\n\nPhotograph: Sebastian Kahnert/dpa/Corbis\n\nDramatic and unusual landscapes fill this region in eastern Germany (not Switzerland), which has more than 700 summits for rock climbers and hundreds of kilometres of marked hiking trails.

The 112km Malerweg trail is a well-trodden route, through a landscape famed for inspiring painters and artists. The park also extends into the Czech Republic.

The tourist board advises good map-reading skills and knowledge of this type of terrain for those who want to visit. Sarek consists of 2,000 sq km of untouched natural habitat, making it a natural playground for experienced adventurers.

Rugged rock formations, boulders and steep mountains jut out of the often other-worldly landscape. One of the highlights is the Litlverivassforsen waterfall, which tumbles off the edge of Litlverivatnet lake. There are trails to follow, as well as cabins to pitch up in at night, and nearby Sjunkhatten and Junkerdal national parks are also within easy reach for those who want to explore further. \nPort-Cros, France\nPinterest\n\nPhotograph: Alamy\n\nGiens peninsula\n, as are its sister islands, Porquerolles, and Levant, the latter said to be the birthplace of European nudism.

You know how a ciabatta sandwich is normally half the ciabatta \u201cloaf\u201d? Well, at Anderson & Hill you get the full thing, stuffed. On my New Yorker there was sliced-to-order, extra-peppery pastrami, complex Neapolitan salami, a dense thicket of pickles and a poky French mustard.

It is in a tiny unit beneath a railway bridge, and the bakery specialises in serious sandwiches (baba ganoush and roasted peppers; meatloaf and Swiss cheese), served on its own slow-fermented breads. It also serves salads, soups, frittata and various hot specials. Its pulled pork was a great thick tangle of meat, the pork all hot, treacly and supremely savoury thanks to its various rubs, marinades and sauces. The cakes are not to be missed either.

While venues might be designed for a resident orchestra, without pop concerts and comedy shows many would struggle to balance the books. The long reverberance that enhances the orchestral sound can turn pop music and speech into a muddy cacophony. Most halls therefore have some way of changing the acoustics.

The breathing and fidgeting of the audience actually creates more sound than other background noises. Only in intense moments where the audience collectively hold its breath, can this deep silence be heard. Take a backstage tour of the Bridgewater Hall, and you will be told the story of the IRA bomb that on 15 June 1996 broke virtually every window in the city centre.

By breaking the audience into blocks, the intervening walls can be used to reflect more sound to the audience from the sides. Scharoun noted that \u201cpeople always gather in circles when listening to music informally\u201d, and this inspired the radical concept of music in the round.

The Philharmonie is not a facsimile of an old venerated hall, but an auditorium of its time, one that could only be built now by exploiting modern acoustic engineering.

But Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s 1956 Federal Highway Act changed everything. The bigger, newer and faster four-lane interstate system bypassed Route 66 and was the beginning of its demise. Businesses shut, towns suffered from loss of tourism and parts of the route were abandoned altogether.

Weeping willow branches gently stir its surface, stilted wooden houses dot the banks and locals are dropped off at their island homes by a long, polished-wood boat \u2013 a water taxi. We are only 45 minutes by train from downtown \nBuenos Aires\n and yet, from here on, it\u2019s waterborne transport only.\nThis is the Paran\u00e1 delta, a 300km network of waterways that stretches from central \nArgentina\n to the gaping mouth of the River Plate. It\u2019s a vast stretch of lush green land chopped into hundreds of islands by veins of water running in all directions. The islands on the northern edge of the delta, towards the border with Uruguay, are mostly uninhabited but, here, near the gateway town of Tigre, there\u2019s a thriving community of around 4,000 residents \u2013 and many more on summer weekends.\nOn the edge of Greater Buenos Aires, 30km north of the centre, Tigre is where \nporte\u00f1os\n (Buenos Aires locals) come to unwind. During my four years living in Argentina, this was my getaway, too. Aside from the year-round blue skies, those Saturday morning jaunts \u2013 a train ticket costs less than \u00a31 \u2013 are probably what I\u2019ve missed the most since returning to the UK.\nThe Argentinian capital is famous for turning its back on the River Plate \u2013 most of its buildings face away from it \u2013 but Tigre is where city dwellers reconnect with the water.

For some time, I\u2019d do what most visitors do: turn up at the \nfluvial\n (boat station), buy a ticket to an island restaurant, and while away most of the day eating, drinking and watching the river traffic from a comfortable deck. But what I wanted to know, as I watched the passing water taxis and occasional city-boy speedboats, was where were they all going?\nPinterest\n\nBoat carrying local commuters in Tigre. Photograph: Getty Images/Panoramic Images\n\nThe answer was to start exploring, and the best way to do it seemed to be by kayak. Friends and I would hire them from the rowing club opposite the boat station (\n about \u00a310 a day) and we\u2019d tentatively paddle across the main drag of the Luj\u00e1n River, which flows past Tigre towards the Plate. We always experienced a moment of mild panic when faced with intimidatingly large tour boats and ferries heading to Uruguay, but the moment we turned down a mysterious, shady side stream, all was calm. There\u2019d be barely any boat traffic to negotiate \u2013 just a few fellow kayakers \u2013 so we could concentrate on some serious daydreaming. The backwaters of Tigre are the sort of place romantic types instantly want to move to. In your head, you abandon all practicalities and start picking out your dream home \u2013 the one where the family labrador comes bounding down the jetty, or the one with a rickety front porch that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in the US deep south.\nasado\n (barbecue joint) and put down our paddles for an hour or two.

Vegetarians might want to bring some back-up snacks, but some larger places do simple pasta dishes. You will be given a choice of \u201cred, white or pink\u201d sauce. Nothing is overly complicated around here.\nPinterest\n\nA riverside restaurant near Tigre.

The name \u2013 meaning hidden island \u2013 says it all. I told the water taxi driver that\u2019s where I was heading and he dropped me on a wooden jetty. From there I walked away from the main riverfront, through an empty plot of land and found a white clapboard villa, built in 1892 and facing a totally secluded little stream.\nAs a guesthouse, it\u2019s deliberately a little rough around the edges, its boho vibe underlined by artsy birdcages hanging from trees, Moroccan daybeds in the garden and a Thai-style floating cabin (available to rent). But the overall effect is full of charm and utterly romantic. My bedroom had an original bathroom, with an old claw-foot bath (a real hand-me-down, not a try-hard import). It also offers a day package (\u00a344pp) which includes return boat transport, use of indoor and outdoor pools, yoga, fishing, canoes and a trouser-popping barbecue lunch.\nPinterest\n\nThe pool at Isla Escondida. Photograph: Vicky Baker\n\nIt was after one of those lunches that I first went exploring on foot. On many of the islands, small groups of houses have formed into mini-communities. A trail by the waters\u2019 edge led me first to a guy in his twenties who was practising aerial acrobatics on a big purple ribbon hanging from a tree; further round the bend, I found an artist\u2019s ramshackle house, fronted by a huge sculpture of a jaguar\u2019s head made from painted sheet metal (a nod to the big cats that once roamed these wilds, giving them the name Tigre).\nThis was the delta I had always wanted to get to know, with all its characters and eccentricities. The area has long been a draw for artists, writers and even heads of state. The house lived in by President Domingo Sarmiento until his death in 1888 is now a museum; famed Uruguayan architect Carlos P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3 used the delta as his muse for 30 years until his death last year. More poignantly, it was also an escape for many intellectuals and activists who later were \u201cdisappeared\u201d during the 1976-1983 military dictatorship. Novelist Haroldo Conti was one of them and his little wooden house \u2013 still as he left it, with a desk beside the river \u2013 has been opened as a museum. (It\u2019s accessible only by boat, on the Gambado stream \u2013 people find their way around here by giving the names of streams and cross-sections.)\nPinterest\n\nAerial acrobatics near Isla Escondida.

Further up stream, where people still work on the land, there is no electricity and little has changed there in years,\u201d he says. Before leaving, I take another look at the giant wall map at Tigre train station, which covers the whole labyrinth. In an average weekend, you\u2019ll barely see a couple of inches of it.

Even after Charles I had been beheaded in January 1649, the royalists hung on here, declaring the king\u2019s son to be the rightful heir as Charles II. When the castle finally fell, Cromwell persuaded the villagers to help \u201cslight\u201d (destroy) the troublesome redoubt. This they never fully achieved, and when Victoria reigned, centuries later, it became used for growing and storing liquorice. Hence the castle\u2019s picture on Pontefract Cake labels.

Today, the base of his statue is a rallying point for protesters, activists and would-be orators. It is also at the centre of some superb historic walks around the places of his time, including the classic planned centre of Grainger Town, and the Victoria coal tunnel down to the jetties of the Tyne.

Five of the walkers were arrested \u2013 and some of these were jailed for up to six months on charges of violence. The episode helped bring about the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, which in turn fuelled the rambling boom of the post-war decades. \nKinder Scout, now much climbed, is something of a monument to the trespass\n, commanding enormous views of the hills between Manchester and Sheffield.

It was a violent, divisive battle, with the police fiercely criticised for their heavy-handedness. The strike changed the political map irrevocably and greatly weakened the trade union movement. Thirty years on, the so-called black beaches of Durham, once darkened by the spoil from the collieries of Easington, Horden, Hawthorn and Blackhall, look nothing like they did in the final scenes of Get Carter (1971). Much of the coast is now a nature reserve, with a \u201cDurham Heritage\u201d footpath from Seaham to Crimdon passing close to the old mines.\n800th anniversary of Magna Carta, Runnymede, Surrey\nMonths of celebrations are planned around 15 June, the date of the great charter\u2019s sealing 800 years ago.

Also, there\u2019ll be a visit by the American Bar Association \u2013 the US constitution was greatly influenced by the Charter\u2019s principles. The meeting between King John and his barons is thought to have taken place on Magna Carta Island in the Thames at Runnymede.

This easily accessible viewing point is only a short walk from a large parking area.\u00a0\nDeath Valley links\nhistory\nlodging\nBadwater Ultramarathon\nYosemite national park\nYosemite is best explored over at least several days. Overnight accommodation ranges from \nwilderness camping\n to cabins to the luxurious \nAhwahnee Hotel\n, with doubles from $360 a night.\nTop tips\n Yosemite's towering granite walls are too tall to be seen through a car windshield; this park is best experienced on foot. The one-mile Glacier Point and 1\u00bd-mile Tuolumne Meadow trails offer short but spectacular strolls, or tackle the more strenuous 7.2-mile walk to the top of Yosemite Falls. The harrowing 14-mile hike up Half Dome requires clinging to cables bolted into the rock face, as well as luck in the much-coveted permit lottery.\u00a0\nYosemite links\nreservations\nwalking\nhow to apply for a Half Dome permit\nPoint Reyes national seashore\n\nPoint Reyes beach. Photograph: Alamy www.alamy.com\n\nPoint Reyes is only an hour north of San Francisco (as long as traffic is moving at a reasonable clip over the Golden Gate bridge), and the park offers backcountry and boat-in camping. Permits and a willingness to rough it are required; no car or RV camping is available. Hiking trails abound: short ones (less than a mile) include the Earthquake trail, which straddles the San Andreas fault, and the Kule Loklo trail, which takes in a restored coastal Miwok Native American village. Those with more time and energy can set off on the US's longest hike, the 6,800-mile American Discovery Trail, from Point Reyes all the way east to the Atlantic Ocean.\u00a0\nTop tips\n The only indoor lodging in the park is at the \nPoint Reyes Youth Hostel\n, which offers dorm beds ($25) and private rooms (from $82, sleep up to five) to travellers of all ages. Reservations highly recommended.\u00a0\nPoint Reyes links\ncampsites\nwhale watching\nhiking\nJoshua Tree national park\n\nPhotograph: Alamy www.alamy.com\n\nThe other stars of Joshua Tree are the stars themselves: with no humidity and skies devoid of light pollution, the Milky Way is overwhelmingly vivid. For an out-of-this-world experience, try scheduling your trip during a meteor shower, such as the Orionids in October, the Leonids in November, or the Geminids in December. Summers in the Mojave Desert are sweltering, but the weather in early spring, late fall and winter is usually delightful.\nThere are nine campsites scattered through the park. Only two \u2013 Black Rock and Cottonwood \u2013 provide running water, and none offers an RV hookup. The park is 125 miles east of Los Angeles, near the desert oases of Twenty-nine Palms and Palm Springs, which offer air-conditioned accommodations ranging from cheap dives to upscale hotels.\u00a0\nTop tips\n Keep an eye out for bighorned sheep on the 7.2-mile round trip trail to the Lost Palms Oasis, a strenuous but rewarding hike that follows an ancient Native American footpath to a cool oasis hidden deep in a boulder canyon.\nJoshua Tree links\ntrails\ncamping\nclimbing and routes\n; climbing guides:\u00a0\nLassen Volcanic national park\n\nPhotograph: Alamy\n\nThe park is capped by 10,462-foot Lassen Peak, the world's largest volcanic dome. Lassen's 1915 blast makes it one of only two volcanoes to have erupted in the continental US in the 20th century (the other being Washington's Mount Saint Helens in 1980). After the eruption, which laid waste to vast swaths of surrounding land, Lassen Volcanic national park was created to preserve the devastated areas for future observation and study. Visiting the area now, nearly 100 years later, is a dramatic lesson in the Earth's own healing powers; it still bears vast scars of hardened lava, but between the rocks, the flora and fauna are flourishing.\nIn the summer, Lassen offers over 150 miles of hiking trails to a wide range of volcanic features such as Sulphur Works and Bumpass Hell, the park's largest hydrothermal feature. Despite all the underground heat, Lassen is also known for receiving epic snowfalls \u2013 sometimes 900 inches in one season! \u2013 that turn the park into a winter wonderland popular with snowshoers, cross-country and backcountry skiers. Lassen has eight seasonal campsites and rustic cabins are available at Manzanita Lake from May to October.\u00a0\nTOP TIP\n Sign up for a photography, geology or birding workshop through the non-profit Lassen Association's Field Seminar Program at Lassen national park.\u00a0\nLassen links\nhiking\namping and cabins\nLassen Association\nSequoia and Kings Canyon national parks\n\nPhotograph: Alamy www.alamy.com\n\nSequoia is home to the largest tree in the world, by volume.

Sequoia also boasts 4,421m Mount Whitney, the high point of the John Muir Trail, which runs through Sequoia and Kings Canyon on its way up to Yosemite.\u00a0\nTOP TIP\n The Giant Forest in Sequoia national park is home to five of the 10 largest trees in the world, including the General Sherman.

They formed when steep, narrow canyons filled with boulders, leaving passages between the rocks.

A potholed gravel road runs to a campsite at the mouth of the Mattole river and from there you can wander south down the coast for 25 miles before you come to the next road, at Shelter Cove. The hike is mostly flat, but walking on sand with a pack is tiring and you'll need tide charts to help navigate past the towering headlands.

This is the place to come to indulge in the country's fantastic seafood \u2013 glass cabinets display fabulous tiger prawns, huge red scarlet shrimp, spikey shellfish (known as spiny dye-murex), crab, lobster, oysters, and of course, the classics in every Portuguese restaurant: clams and \npercebes\n (barnacles). Originally opened in 1956, Ramiro's is a well-oiled machine with slick, speedy service from waiters who zip about holding giant platters of seafood aloft, but still have time for a joke with regulars, or to indulge children \u2013 my son was given paper and pencils and lots of hair ruffles. Piles of toasted bread dripping in garlic butter are brought to your table while you wait \u2013 and replenished when you inevitably polish them off. If you can, leave room for a prego, a steak sandwich which is usually served after the seafood. Get there early to avoid queuing, although the staff do their best to keep hungry punters happy, offering drinks to those standing in line. \nAvenida Almirante Reis 1, +351 21 885 1024, \ncervejariaramiro.pt\nDecadente, Bairro Alto\nRua de S\u00e3o Pedro de Alcantara 81, +351 21 346 13 81, \ntheindependente.pt\nCantinho do Avillez, Chiado\nJos\u00e9 Avillez is one of Portugal's most famous chefs, a trailblazer in the same mould as Ferran Adri\u00e0 and Heston Blumenthal, and owner of Michelin-starred Belcanto and the new Mini Bar, a bar with gourmet, experimental canap\u00e9s. Cantinho do Avillez, his bistro, is a small, simple room embellished with industrial chic features \u2013 factory lights and a concrete floor. Olives were brought to our table with a delicious tomato and olive oil dip and filigree-thin toast. The menu cherry-picks from international cuisines with the likes of lamb tagine, steak tartar with New York potatoes and suckling pig with Asian flavours. My tuna main course was the most tender piece of the fish I've ever eaten, and prawns were sweet and fresh. Go at lunchtime and order the steak sandwich (\u20ac8.75) or dish of the day (\u20ac10.50) to keep the bill down. Even at night, the prices (starters from \u20ac4.50, mains from \u20ac17.25 and deserts from \u20ac5) are a lot less than you would pay for a similar meal and service in many other European cities.

Many have been in the same spot for decades, their original wrought iron restored; newer ones are replicas but are painted the same classy racing green as the originals. As an example, the kiosk opposite the Independente hostel in Bairro Alto sells draft Sagres for \u20ac2, coffee for \u20ac1.20, sandwiches from \u20ac3.80 and soup of the day for \u20ac3. Come at happy hour (6-9pm) when a (150ml) beer costs \u20ac1.50 and a caipirinha \u20ac6, and nab one of the deckchairs offering views across the terracotta rooftops.\nLargo da Graca 43\nAtira-te ao Rio, Cacilhas\nCais do Gingal 69/70, +351 21 275 1380, \natirateaorio.pt\nSeaMe, Chiado\nA modern take on the seafood restaurant, SeaMe has solid wooden tables, waiting staff in grey Mao-style jackets, waitresses sporting I'm a Fish addict T-shirts, and a menu sprinkled with slogans ... 'Good things come to those who wait', and so on. Naff wording aside, SeaMe offers an Asian-inspired menu that makes an interesting change from the classics seen in most other restaurants. Alongside sushi and sashimi there's pan fried Azores parrot fish; seared tuna comes with wasabi ice-cream; and other fish listed include John Dory, grouper, turbot, cod, red mullet and Dover sole. \nRua do Loreto 21, +351 21 346 1564, \n'The Nuns' Canteen' (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Cat\u00f3lica Internacional ao Servi\u00e7o da Juventude Feminina \u2013 ACISJF)\n\nIsabel Choat\n\nTucked away on an unmarked side street, with a discreet sign on the door, this is a place few Lisboans know about, let alone tourists.

This is an unpretentious, no-frills campsite with an unapologetically back-to-basics approach. Facilities are fairly basic \u2013 there's no reception or shop, and the only source of provisions is the farmhouse in the village offering eggs and milk. The remote location and scant facilities almost makes it feel like you've stumbled upon a bygone era \u2013 but spend a few days relaxing in Buttermere, gazing into the bubbling beck and eating too many locally made ice-creams, and you'll begin to understand exactly why this campsite is so well-loved.\nSyke Farm Camping Ground\n, 01768 770222.

Sitting serenely in the heart of the valley is Baysbrown Farm, which looks out over three generously sized camping fields. There are no designated pitches here; just rock up and find a suitable corner to call home. The site lies beneath the humbling rocks of Crinkle Crags, Bowfell and the Langdale Pikes, giving a sense of scale rarely found in the Lakes. Peering out from your tent each morning at the mist-shrouded peaks is worth the pitch fee alone.\nBaysbrown Farm\n, Great Langdale, 01539 437150. Adults \u00a34, children \u00a32 per night.

Rabbits and sheep roam unfettered and unfazed on this working farm, so don't be surprised to be woken by the sound of sheep snacking on the tasty grass around your tent. Head to the farmhouse each morning to stock up on fresh milk and eggs, or visit the small hut down by the walking track for a hearty English breakfast. With its picturesque views and easy access to water and walking, Gillside Farm is low-key camping at its finest.\nGillside Farm\n, 01768 482346.

The view from the island stretches all the way from the \nLake District\n hills across Morecambe Bay, and along the Fylde Coast to Blackpool Tower. While camping is allowed almost anywhere on the island, the \"official\" campsite is in a slight dip and is further protected by shrubs, which help divert the Atlantic winds.

It's a typical National Trust campsite: well-organised, efficiently run, and set in some of England's finest scenery. As you would expect, the walking from here is first-class, with many visitors here to conquer the Langdale Pikes, the triumvirate of peaks that dominate the skyline.

Just up the road from the main site is a very private wild camping spot, which can be reserved by private arrangement.

Its thatched cabins (which sleep two to six and range from basic to fully equipped) are on Pampelonne beach, where bling-lovers pay over the odds to access the area's private beach clubs. Huts are linked by sandy paths and shaded by palm trees but you're not here to chill out: five restaurants have a party vibe, there are lots of watersports and kids activities, and the site has a circus.

You'll see people digging for clams, cyclists rolling through villages of whitewashed cottages and rows of salt pans for the harvesting of \nfleur de sel \n(fine sea salt).\nThere's a pool, a spa, a restaurant and a\u00a0kids' club, plus a p\u00e9tanque park, table tennis and crazy golf. Inside, the cabins are rustic chic, with plump duvets and rain showers, and fully-fitted kitchens where you can cook the mussels you buy from the seafood shacks and the samphire you collect from the beach. None of this comes cheap, but there are a few more affordable pitches for traditional camping. The best thing is that you feel so close to nature, where a stroll down a track by the side of a windmill will bring you to the beach.\n +33 2 51 39 51 38, \n.

There are lots of activities on site and a watersports centre at the lake. The\u00a0campsite arranges events such as wine tastings; and, as well as two kids' pools, there is an adults-only spa.

An onsite chef cooks your meals, and there are nightly campfires and beach parties. It's suitable for all, including beginners, and a daily surf lesson is included in the price.

This camping village is right next to one of them: a 100-metre path leads from the campsite to a sandy beach and sheltered, calm sea.

An intimate space with a great sound system, the club is also associated with the exclusive artists' society \nDe Kring\n, which is based on the floor below. It all sounds very secretive, but the vibe inside is remarkably laid-back and friendly. On certain nights, such as the eclectic Kiss Escort parties, De Kring opens its doors to the public and the venue effectively becomes a two-in-one club, where DJs are spread across the two floors and play a mixture of underground hip-hop, deep house and soul.\nKorte Leidsedwarsstraat 26-1, \nclubup.nl\nTrouw\n\nPhotograph: Juha van 't Zelfde/http://www.flickr.com/photos/8759761@N06/3493272789/\n\nWho said the printing press was dead? It's alive in this part of town, but not as you might know it. Located in the former printing plant of the Dutch newspaper Trouw, this renovated industrial space has been transformed into one of the city's best clubbing venues. Stark concrete walls, industrial lighting rigs and defunct machinery only enhance the atmosphere created by pulsing minimal electro, while the shreds and remains of old newspapers \u2013 scattered all around the venue \u2013 make for interesting eye candy in between dancing. More recently, Trouw has become home to the legendary Amsterdam club night Rauw, with the likes of Erol Alkan, Larry Tee and Crookers all making appearances in the past few months. \n Wibautstraat 131, \ntrouwamsterdam.nl/en\nStudio 80\nThis is a breeding ground for upcoming electro talent, and the main hangout of bespectacled hipsters, arty types and gay fashionistas in Amsterdam. Despite being stowed between a couple of largely uninteresting bars on the touristy Rembrandtplein, Studio 80's dimly lit interior, innovative DJs and charismatic clientele make it one of the hippest clubs in the city. Minimal techno is primarily the music of choice, with camp clubbers often donning fluorescent eye-make up and glittery garments as they take to the podiums scattered around the dancefloor. Expect an open-minded atmosphere, some serious techno heads , kohl-eyed divas and a good dose of androgyny.\n Rembrandtplein 17, \nstudio-80.nl\nOT301\n\nPhotograph: Rawfare/http://www.flickr.com/photos/rawfare/4718446162/\n\nOT301 may now be recognised as an official cultural centre, but it's still easy to recognise the anarchic roots of this former squatted film school. Entering the club involves being escorted by a rather boorish doorman down a graffiti-laden corridor and into a large, slightly derelict-looking building. Once inside, the ferocity of the sound system soon takes hold of the crowd as they lap up cheap bottled beer and enjoy the freedom to smoke anywhere in the building (often much to the annoyance of non-smokers). Despite its \"official\" status, OT301 remains a decidedly underground club night, where the music usually veers towards dubstep, old-school acid house and drum'n'bass.\n Overtoom 301, \not301.nl\nBitterzoet\nIn a city saturated with electro clubs and fist-pounding techno heads, Bitterzoet offers a respite for those who prefer to embrace the urban, jazzy and soulful side of clubbing. The cosy, crimson-lit bar area has a casual but effortlessly sexy vibe, and the dance floor soon fills up with hip-grinding soul cats on selected club nights. The weekly Struttin' party (Fridays) is the longest-running funk and soul night in the city, with DJs Alviz, Bart Fader and Taco Fett spinning on a strictly vinyl-only policy. According to Alviz, it's \"simply about having a good time: dancing, drinking, flirting and enjoying quality soul 45s\".\n Spuistraat 2, \nSupperclub\n Jonge Roelensteeg 21, \nSugar Factory\n\nPhotograph: Femke Van Veen Femke Van Veen/PR\n\nSelf-described as a \"cutting-edge multi-disciplinary night theatre\", Sugar Factory has found its niche as a platform where performance meets clubbing. New Media events are often paired with techno acts and live performance artists usually feature alongside DJs on club nights. Formerly a theatre, it has a large stage peering over the main dancefloor, where scantily clad performers often encourage the crowd to cut a rug of their own. Wicked Jazz Sounds hosts weekly parties where DJs, live musicians, singers and actors do improv live, while the Electronation night offers some of Amsterdam's finest electro talent, with the likes of Max Cooper and Mason holding regular slots. Sweet it most certainly is.\n Lijnbaansgracht 238, \nsugarfactory.nl\nNestled among a crop of new cafes, bars and creative enterprises in the Westergasfabriek (a former gasworks turned city park and cultural hub) this spacious club feels a bit like a classic American diner that's been hired out for an art school reunion. The crowd here is made up of mature arty types reliving their hedonistic youth, ogling one another and quite often playing air guitar on the tables. On paper, it sounds like a bit of a nightmare, but the anything-goes atmosphere and hormone-fueled flirtations between the clientele make this a thoroughly entertaining night out. The music is a fun mix of northern soul, surf rock and 1970s disco; basically every genre that has a tendency to make people electric slide their way to the bar. The lack of entrance charge is an added bonus.\n Polonceaukade 23, \nCanvas\n Wibautstraat 150, \nJimmy Woo\nA swanky joint with a decidedly cosmopolitan feel, Jimmy Woo attracts swarms of glamorous young socialites clad in decadent clothing and wearing shiny jewellery. Skinny supermodels pout nonchalantly in dimly lit corners, Dutch celebrities mingle with visiting VIPs and bottles of Mo\u00ebt are casually passed around like communal hip flasks. While it all might sound a tad superficial, the music \u2013 an eclectic mix of hip-hop, Baltimore club and house \u2013 makes up for the occasional discomfort caused by the troupes of self-loving young pretty things.\n Korte Leidsedwarsstraat 18, \n Arun Sood writes for \nAmsterdam Magazine", "source": "guardian", "keywords": ["club", "nl", "djs", "soul", "ot301"], "guid": "http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jun/18/amsterdam-10-best-clubs"}

Pretot\nCANNES, France\nAfter making a selection from 1,854 films, festival director Thierry Fremaux said this edition, which opens on Wednesday, would stand out for the new names it introduces. \n\"We put new names on the map and we'll see in 12 days what will be the result of everything,\" he told Reuters.\nApart from the screening, parties and deal-making that mark the festival every year, Fremaux has had to consider an activity of more recent origin - selfies - and what they mean for Cannes. \n\"The film could be late and in Cannes, we respect time,\" said Fremaux, who thinks selfies are \"ridiculous and grotesque\".\nFAMILIAR FACES\nThere will be plenty of familiar faces at the festival this year, with the feature film jury being presided by Joel and Ethan Coen. \nThe 2012 jury president, Nanni Moretti, is in competition with \"Mia Madre\" as well as Palme d'Or laureate Gus van Sant (\"The Sea of Trees\") and Todd Haynes (\"Carol\").  \nHollywood is pitching in by holding the world premiere for \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" on Thursday, and there will be plenty of other Hollywood and world stars on the red carpet.\nFremaux, however, was disappointed by the American cinema's offering. \"It's wonderful to have Gus Van Sant, to have Todd Haynes, to have Woody Allen or to have George Miller - he's Australian but it's an American film,\" he said. \"But in America, they must pay more attention to auteur cinema.\"\nVariety critic Jay Weissberg said the most anticipated film could well be a new version of Shakespeare's much-filmed \"Macbeth\", starring French actress Marion Cotillard and Germany's Michael Fassbender.\n\"These are two powerhouse actors, actors who we respect enormously who've shown an extraordinary range...It's one of the most anticipated titles,\" he said.\nThe festival will open for the first time with a woman director's film, \"La Tete Haute\" by Emmanuelle Bercot and starring French icon Catherine Deneuve, but Weissberg thought that did little to compensate for a general lack of women in the directing profession.\n\"We need to ask why there aren't more women directors...We need the profession of director to be more open to women.\"\nOther films in the various festival strands deal with heavy topics of prostitution and poverty in Latin America, but Weissberg said the lineup still had what it takes to put Cannes on the world media map and in the pages of the glossy fanzines.\n\"Cannes has to be a combination of glamour combined with kitsch combined with a sort of cheap glamour, sexy glamour as well as the more meaty part of the festival which is why most of us are here.\"\n (Reporting by Julien Pretot, Matthew Stock, Rollo Ross and Michael Roddy; Editing by \nTom Heneghan\n\n                            \tA Chopard

Online\nThese three scenes don't appear to have been filmed in chronological order. In the second, Kim is obscuring her supposedly pregnant stomach with a pillow.\nMost fans of reality TV shows give their favorite franchises some leeway when it comes to the word \"reality,\" especially when their guilty pleasure of choice is \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians,\" which depicts a family of incredibly image-conscious PR pros.\nMariah Smith\nMariah Smith has a passion for the Kardashians.\nBut one KUWTK superfan, Mariah Smith, knows exactly how cut-and-pasted each episode is, because she spends up to twelve hours a week figuring it out for her blog.\nSmith runs \nthe Tumblr Keeping Up With the Kontinuity Errors\n, where she painstakingly matches every scene of every KUWTK episode with paparazzi shots or Instagram selfies posted by the cast members.\nThrough this methodology, she determines when each scene was shot.\nUnsurprisingly, she's found plenty of proof that the show is often shot completely out of order.\nFor example, this past week on KUWTK, Kylie Jenner deals with scrutiny from the press about her lip injections. In an early scene of this episode, Kylie sits down with a reporter from New Zealand's Remix magazine.\nHe asks about her lips, and she looks uncomfortable and avoids talking about possible injections.\nIn a confessional interview (when you see the reality star talking directly to the camera about what's happening in the scene), she says that she's not ready to admit that she has used fillers.\nSeveral scenes later, she talks with Teen Vogue editor-in-chief Amy Astley, and says in another confessional that she's \"now ready to be honest about her appearance and stop dodging questions about her lips,\" Smith writes on KUWTKE.\nBut Smith found that the Teen Vogue interview took place on Feb. 6, 2015, while the Remix interview - which was presented as having taken place earlier - was actually shot on Feb. 10, four days later.\n\"Maybe Kylie was too busy studying for a midterm, and forgot mere days ago she was ready to live her truth,\" Smith posits on KUWTKE.\nSmith told Business Insider that she got into her unofficial gig as the internet's foremost KUWTK plot de-bunker because she absolutely loves the show.\nThe banner on KUWTKE.tumblr.com\n\"I never want it to be taken as me bashing them, like never,\" she said. \"But I feel like people deserve to know the truth. What they're presenting as real isn't real at all, but we can still watch and enjoy.\"\nSmith matches screenshots to Instagram posts to date each scene.\nShe's been watching the show for years, but only started her blog this season. The seed was planted back in season eight, though, when Kim's pregnancy presented some continuity challenges, as pictured at the top of this post.\nIn the 16th episode of season eight, Smith thought she noticed that Kim Kardashian was pregnant in one scene, but not pregnant anymore in a scene that allegedly took place shortly after that scene. In the second scene, she is suspiciously holding a pillow over her stomach the entire time.\nSmith is unsure whether this sequence was actually shot out of order because she hasn't cross-checked it with Instagram posts or paparazzi shots. But she says Kim's hairstyles speak for themselves; they varied immensely throughout the first few scenes of S8,E16.\n\"It was staged so obviously that it offended me but completely enlightened me,\" Smith said. \"I realized this could really be something. I wish I had realized it sooner.\"\nSmith says she wouldn't have been able to embark on this project any time earlier than the last few years, as the Kardashians have steadily beefed up their Instagram presence since then.\n\"When I first started thinking about doing this, they weren't as big on social media, so it was harder to look at things like their glam or their makeup,\" she said. \"Then, this year, I realized just how much they post and how much you're aware of them every day, so it made the most sense. It's a perfect storm, essentially.\"\u00a0\n\"Honestly, it is,\" she said with a laugh, \"and that's been really unfortunate.\"\nTo create each blog post on KUWTKE, Smith watches each new episode when it airs on Sunday night. Then, she watches it again to take notes of each scene and describe the action of the scene. The next day, she will go through each scene and analyze the wardrobe, nails, hair and makeup of the characters onscreen, then find the Instagram photos or paparazzi photos that match the looks.\nFrom there, she selects which scenes are most important, which errors are most egregious, and her favorite moments from the show. Then, she writes her post. She sometimes watches an episode up to four times before writing about it.\n\"This is so embarrassing,\" she said, \"but sometimes it can take up to 12 hours to figure it all out.\"\nSmith works in TV production, which has helped her pick up on other little things on the show. For example, she says crew members are frequently visible in reflective surfaces. In fact, she noticed that the chrome appliances in Kris's kitchen used to constantly show crew members' reflections, but that they no longer do. She speculates that they've been treated to stop showing reflections.\nShe is also good at spotting what seems like the handiwork of production assistants, like a pizza-box marriage proposal that allegedly came from a Kylie stalker in a recent episode that centered around Kris's growing security concerns and paranoia.\n\"There's no way Domino's would be getting past a gated community in Calabasas,\" she said. \"Think of the logistics. And there would be a line producer, like, 'We didn't order this, what's this doing here?'\"\nIn that episode, according to Smith's research, essentially an entire storyline was shot in one day, on Feb. 3, 2015. She deduced this by cross-checking \nKylie's\naccount\npaparazzi photos of Kendall\nKim selfie from later in the day \na Khloe selfie\n\u00a0with the Kardashians' and Jenners' hair, makeup and/or clothes from the scenes.\nAll in one day, Kris hired, fired, then complained about the lack of security on her property,\" Smith alleges on KUTWKE.\n\"To me, it makes me laugh and makes me feel happy,\" she said of the show's apparent lack of real-ness. \"They have the confidence to say, 'We're gonna give you this reality show, but get this: it's not gonna be real.' It just blows my mind.\"\nSmith has picked up on plenty of shooting tricks from her exhaustive work cataloging the Kardashians' onscreen beauty looks. For example, the family often has what she calls \"inside days,\" where they shoot multiple scenes inside one person's house, changing only their clothes and the room where they're shooting. Then, Smith says, the scenes are dispersed across multiple episodes to serve multiple plot points.\n\"I have so many theories,\" she joked. \"Sometimes I feel like I need to take a break and stop thinking about them.\"\nSmith doesn't think the Kardashians will quell their selfie habits because of her blog.\nThe most surprising thing she's learned while chronicling season 10 has been how long the Kardashians work.\n\"They do actually work long hours filming the show,\" she said. \"Sometimes, the crew is there at 7 a.m. and they get glam and they're still in that look and it's like 8 p.m. that night.\"\nSmith reiterated that the show's not-quite-cinema-verite approach doesn't cheapen her love for the family as entertainers.\nNOW WATCH: \nHow to skip long lines at the airport - just like the 1%", "source": "business_insider", "keywords": ["smith", "scene", "kardashians", "episode", "scenes", "instagram"], "guid": "http://www.businessinsider.in/How-one-woman-is-using-the-Kardashians-Instagram-posts-to-expose-the-truth-behind-their-popular-show/articleshow/47257335.cms?utm_source=ten_minutes_with&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Content_Patnership"}
